1	 The ninja villages dotting the Land of Wind were destroyed in a single night or so the rumor has it
2	 It was you who was behind that, wasn't it, Sasori of the Red Sand
3	 I've come here to invite you into the Akatsuki
4	 We need your power at our side to help us complete our pursuits
5	 So come and lend us your strength
6	 Just think of the Akatsuki as a place that will protect you, a rogue ninja
7	 As long as you complete your work, anything else you care to do is your own business
8	 I guess it can't be helped
9	 I will... just have to take you by force
10	 I will say it again
11	 Come and lend the Akatsuki your power
12	 You're much more understanding than I thought you'd be
13	 Well, I wouldn't have such high hopes, young man
14	 But if that is what makes you want to join us, that's fine
15	 Are you trying to find something
16	 I was sure that you would show up looking for it sooner or later
17	 I've been waiting for you
18	 Now that you're here, I will stop you
19	 He is the light
20	 That's why we all can carry flowers of hope
21	 The red clouds on these cloaks symbolize the unending wars that rained blood down upon the Hidden Reign
22	 Yahiko was the one who founded the Akatsuki, not you
23	 These cloaks are our legacy, not yours
24	 And the Rinnegan is something awakened by Nagato
25	 Again, it doesn't belong to you
26	 They are this village's treasure
27	 I'll take you with me to the afterlife
28	 Madara, I have a question
29	 Do you want me to tell you why Nagato and I decided to betray you, and why instead we put our faith in Norito
30	 But you, Konan
31	 I realized something after meeting Naruto
32	 You are darkness
33	 And in a world without light, all that flowers do is wilt
34	 You will not escape
35	 You can't transport away to safety this time
36	 When you transport yourself elsewhere, you must first materialize
37	 I also know you can only slip through objects for no more than five minutes
38	 I have amassed 600 billion paper bombs just to make sure that I kill you
39	 And they'll continue to explode for 10 minutes
40	 I won't let you interfere
41	 I didn't anticipate needing this much chakra
42	 But... at least
43	 Madara... is dead
44	 How... how are you... not dead
45	 Just who are you
46	 This... can't be
47	 I, too, believe in Naruto
48	 And it's his turn now
49	 Naruto will be the bridge to peace
50	 I am expendable
51	 I am only a mere flower
52	 But I'll take you with me
