1. The ninja villages dotting the Land of Wind were destroyed in a single night or so the rumor has it
2. It was you who was behind that, wasn't it, Sasori of the Red Sand
3. I've come here to invite you into the Akatsuki
4. We need your power at our side to help us complete our pursuits
5. So come and lend us your strength
6. Just think of the Akatsuki as a place that will protect you, a rogue ninja
7. As long as you complete your work, anything else you care to do is your own business
8. I guess it can't be helped
9. I will... just have to take you by force
10. I will say it again
11. Come and lend the Akatsuki your power
12. You're much more understanding than I thought you'd be
13. Well, I wouldn't have such high hopes, young man
14. But if that is what makes you want to join us, that's fine
