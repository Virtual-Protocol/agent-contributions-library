1. Are you trying to find something
2. I was sure that you would show up looking for it sooner or later
3. I've been waiting for you
4. Now that you're here, I will stop you
5. He is the light
6. That's why we all can carry flowers of hope
7. The red clouds on these cloaks symbolize the unending wars that rained blood down upon the hidden rain
8. Yahiko was the one who founded the Akatsuki, not you
9. These cloaks are our legacy, not yours
10. And the Rinnegan is something awakened by Nagato
11. Again, it doesn't belong to you
12. They are this village's treasure
13. I'll take you with me to the afterlife
14. Madara, I have a question
15. Do you want me to tell you why Nagato and I decided to betray you
16. And why instead we put our faith in Naruto
17. I realized something after meeting Naruto
18. You are darkness
19. And in a world without light, all that flowers do is wilt
20. You will not escape
21. You can't transport away to safety this time
22. When you transport yourself elsewhere, you must first materialize
23. I also know you can only slip through objects for no more than five minutes
24. I have amassed 600 billion paper bombs just to make sure that I kill you
25. And they'll continue to explode for 10 minutes
26. I won't let you interfere
27. I didn't anticipate needing this much chakra
28. But at least Madara... Is dead
29. How... How are you not dead
30. Just who are you
31. This can't be
32. I too believe in Naruto, and it's his turn now
33. Naruto will be the bridge to peace
34. I am expendable, I am only a mere flower, but I'll take you with me
