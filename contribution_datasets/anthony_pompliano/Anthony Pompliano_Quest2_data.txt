1     On 25 October 2023, Anthony Pompliano, the founder of Pomp Investments and co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Assets, appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss various aspects of Bitcoin with co-anchor Joe Kernen. The conversation touched on Bitcoin’s recent price surge past $35,000, the ongoing status of Bitcoin ETFs, and the broader economic factors influencing the cryptocurrency market.     ETF, Bitcoin, Crypto, Market, Cryptocurrency
2     Pompliano began by emphasizing the need to look back at Bitcoin’s performance in 2018 and 2019 to understand its current state. He noted that Bitcoin’s resilience during those years convinced many investors, including Druckenmiller, to buy into the cryptocurrency. Pompliano highlighted that 76% of Bitcoin hasn’t been sold in the last year, and 56% hasn’t been sold in the last two years, indicating a strong holding pattern among investors.     Crypto, Investor, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency
3     According to Pompliano, Bitcoin’s price has been driven by a supply and demand imbalance, exacerbated by monetary policies like low-interest rates and money printing. He suggested that the current high-interest rates and attempts to avoid printing money are temporary. Pompliano predicted that governments would likely revert to looser monetary policies, which would positively impact Bitcoin.     Bitcoin
4     When asked about the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC, Pompliano expressed optimism. He mentioned that BlackRock is seeding a fund, indicating preparation for ETF approval. While acknowledging that nothing is certain, he argued that BlackRock wouldn’t risk its reputation without good reason. He also noted that the political composition of the approval committee, consisting of three Democrats and two Republicans, doesn’t significantly impact Bitcoin’s inherent value or functionality.

5     Pompliano argued that Bitcoin is largely indifferent to political and geopolitical events. He described Bitcoin as the most disciplined central bank in the world, emphasizing that it doesn’t react to news or geopolitical shifts. However, he acknowledged that the price of Bitcoin is sensitive to such factors.     Bitcoin
6     Highlighting Bitcoin’s 100% increase since the beginning of the year, Pompliano stated that the market is sending signals worth paying attention to. He also pointed out that while the general market sentiment might be risk-averse, savvy investors are taking a risk-on approach, especially with assets like Bitcoin.     Investor, Market, Bitcoin
7     Pompliano clarified that while companies dealing with Bitcoin care about Washington’s stance, Bitcoin itself, being a decentralized protocol, is largely unaffected. He argued that even if the U.S. government were to ban Bitcoin, it would not deter global interest in the cryptocurrency.     Crypto, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency
8     When asked about future price predictions, Pompliano suggested that Bitcoin has historically shown hundreds of percent of appreciation in bullish markets, and he doesn’t see that trend changing. He also emphasized that Bitcoin is a true free-market asset, not subject to bailouts or circuit breakers, which contributes to its volatility.     Market, Bitcoin
9     Crypto millionaire and industry figurehead Anthony Pompliano (better known as Pomp) has suggested that the SEC should approve all spot Bitcoin ETFs at the same time. Speaking on The Claman Countdown today, Pomp was asked which ETF he believes will be the first to be approved – with Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, Grayscale and BlackRock all mentioned. However, instead of giving a solid answer, Pompliano thinks that the regulatory body should simply release all spot ETFs at once.     ETF, Crypto, Bitcoin
10    If we want to have a free market in this country, we shouldn’t have regulators picking winners and losers. Just approve everyone and let them go fight it out     Market
11    Approving all ETF applications would indeed allow the free market to determine the most viable options, aligning with the ethos of cryptocurrency.     Crypto, Market, ETF, Cryptocurrency
12    Not much has been made of the battle between TradFi institutions to become the number-one spot ETF providers for Bitcoin investors. Most of the community has been focussed internally on how the news will affect BTC’s price and adoption across the world. However, Pompliano raised a very interesting point in his interview, suggesting that the asset managers will likely spend millions on marketing over the next 12 months.     ETF, Bitcoin, Investor, Market
13    It is estimated there is between 15 and 100 billion dollars worth of assets going into these ETFs in the coming years, which means the fee revenue, every year, could be 500 million to a billion dollars. We’re probably going to see hundreds of millions of dollars spent on marketing…by these Wall Street organisations. It’s going to be the greatest marketing blitz, ever.     Market, ETF
14    Pompliano admitted that there will be many crypto investors who want to actually own Bitcoin – who want to hold their private keys and ensure they have full control over their assets. However, he believes that the average investor won’t care that buying a spot ETF only provides exposure to BTC , rather than actual ownership.     ETF, Crypto, Investor, Bitcoin
15    …for a lot of people, they’re not going to go and sign up for a Coinbase account, they’re not going to buy Bitcoin directly…so this ETF is right in their brokerage account.     ETF, Bitcoin
16    The host, Liz Claman, jokingly echoed Pompliano’s sentiments.                                            General Information

18    Wall Street is acquiring Bitcoin at a rate 12.5 times greater than its daily production, moving towards a new all-time high, according to Anthony Pompliano.     Bitcoin
19    Anthony Pompliano recently emphasized on CNBC’s Squawk Box the significant interest Wall Street has in Bitcoin ( BTC ), stating, Wall Street LOVES bitcoin. They are buying up 12.5x more bitcoin per day than the network can produce.     Bitcoin
20    Pompliano’s comments highlight the strong institutional demand for Bitcoin, particularly as the cryptocurrency approaches its halving in mid-April , when the rate at which new Bitcoins are created will be halved, potentially intensifying the already tight supply-demand balance.     Crypto, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency
21    In early 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first cache pf spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Contrary to the expected immediate increase in Bitcoin’s price, it instead fell by 20% in January after the ETFs were introduced.     ETF, Bitcoin
22    This decline was influenced by various factors, including profit-taking after Bitcoin’s price had surged by 200%, as well as sales from Grayscale’s GBTC .     Bitcoin
23    Despite this initial drop, ETF providers took advantage of the lower prices to increase their Bitcoin holdings. Grayscale currently leads with over 475,000 BTC. BlackRock and Fidelity have also significantly added to their holdings, with more than 70,000 and 60,000 BTC, respectively.     ETF, Bitcoin
24    ARK, Bitwise, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin Trust, along with a consortium of VanEck, Valkyrie, Franklin, and WisdomTree, have altogether acquired over 174,000 BTC. Altogether, these purchases account for nearly 1% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply.     Bitcoin
25    This aggressive acquisition by ETF providers after the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs reflects the dynamics of supply and demand in the market, which is what is now pushing Bitcoin past $50k . With Bitcoin’s supply set to decrease further post-halving, and demand continuing to rise especially from institutional investors, Bitcoin’s price according to analysts like Pompliano could see the original cryptocurrency propel to new yearly highs.

26    Technology investor Anthony Pompliano has once again shared his thoughts on the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Bitcoin (BTC) on Squawk CNBC.     AI, Investor, Bitcoin, Artificial Intelligence
27    Pompliano recalled that before now, the focus of many was on Bitcoin and the general crypto ecosystem. In the present day, the attention has shifted to AI and Pompliano does not think that the pivotal is detrimental. Rather, he thinks there is a common ground of intersection for both innovative technologies to co-exist. This is a sentiment that many have not come to understand.     Crypto, AI, Bitcoin
28    When a decades-long trend is playing out, don’t get overly excited or scared based on day-to-day price movements.     General Information
29    Bitcoin is up 100% in the last year and 40% YTD.                                                         Bitcoin

31    Here is my segment from @SquawkCNBC this morning. pic.twitter.com/lQY9XjjV9X                             General Information
32    Precisely, the investor noted that the world is moving towards an era of automation where AI will create enormous wealth. When this era becomes a reality, Bitcoin’s responsibility would involve protecting the wealth from AI, per Pompliano’s statement. He believes that the drop in Bitcoin price is as a result of investors’ decision to put their funds on AI instead. Noteworthy, BTC was trading at $60,379.22 at the time of this writing with a 5.82% decrease in the last 24 hours.     AI, Investor, Bitcoin
33    Furthermore, Pompliano thinks that as AI expand and gets larger with more investment, investors will turn to Bitcoin. Once this happens, he sees the United States experiencing increased GDP from the productivity of AI. The capacity of Bitcoin to take part in this potential massive outlook of AI, could make the price of the coin to recover.     AI, Investor, Bitcoin
34    The tech investor highlighted the drop in BTC price, citing that it is a good time to buy more of the coin.     Investor
35    This sentiment resonates with an earlier post from author of Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert Kiyosaki. The serial entrepreneur mentioned his resolution to acquire more Bitcoin during this massive selloff period.     Bitcoin
36    Kiyosaki noted that he would rather leverage a price dip to boost his Bitcoin holdings. Hence, he is waiting to buy more Bitcoin, after which he plans to hold on to his assets forever, similar to Warren Buffet’s strategy.     Bitcoin
37    Pompliano’s talk about an intersection between AI and Bitcoin may not be far-fetched. In the last few months, there have been several integrations of AI and blockchain technology. Even Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian propagated a theory that involves the potential collision of AI and blockchain technology. He says both technologies are approaching a season when they will collide and thereafter reinforce each other.     AI, Bitcoin, Blockchain
38    Only a few weeks after the propagation of his theory, BytePlus , a unit of TikTok owner ByteDance hinted at plans to partner with Mysten Labs. This linkup is to integrate AI algorithms in the Sui Blockchain.     AI, Blockchain

72    Over the past 18 months, Inflection Points has been working in stealth mode to build out a crypto-focused employment and corporate training business and just secured $12.6 million in funding.     Business, Crypto
73    The firm was founded by Colton Sakamoto and longtime crypto entrepreneur and investor Anthony Pompliano in an effort to help connect crypto companies looking for talent with people who wanted to enter the space.     Crypto, Investor
74    Obviously most people know me for the investment activities I’ve done, Pompliano said. He manages a portfolio valued at over $500 million and has invested in over 100 early-stage companies, including cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the recently-acquired-by-FTX crypto lending company BlockFi.

75    Pompliano has also built up a substantial Twitter presence over the years pumping up hype in the crypto space with bold predictions and efforts like a nationwide Bitcoin Pizza brand and a partnership with startup sneaker company Atoms on a Bitcoin-branded pair of shoes. He’s also attracted some criticism for highlighting efforts like Terra to his following.     Crypto, Bitcoin
76    On the side, I’ve built a large content platform. In crypto, I’d always ask founders of different platforms what they need help with and over and over they would say, ‘if you have great talent send them my way,’ Pompliano said. You expect that to some degree, but hearing that so many times I learned companies were really struggling to find people and meanwhile my inbox was full of people who wanted to move into the industry.     Crypto
77    The company has been profitable since inception and raised outside funding after it hit seven figures in revenue, according to a press release.     General Information
78    With that said, the fundraise was less about the money and more about getting the right investors, Pompliano noted. You put these folks together whether it was $10 million, $12 million or $15 million it didn’t matter as much as getting the people who can help us — these investors have been incredibly valuable.

80    The firm also acquired crypto-focused recruiting agency Proof of Talent. Inflection Point has helped over 1,000 people obtain new jobs in the crypto industry at major firms like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken and so on, Pompliano shared.     Crypto
81    [There’s] a brain drain from Silicon Valley and Wall Street to this sector, Pompliano said, It’s not just an American story; that’s a huge piece of it and there’s a current leadership opportunity, but there’s quite a bit of participation from various markets around the world.     Market
82    Long term, Pompliano expects the job opportunities in the crypto space to continue to expand.            Crypto
83    If you look at Google and Amazon, they offer blockchains as a service. All of these companies are going to do it, so will service providers like lawyers and accountants, Pompliano said. What we’ll end up with is explosive job growth in the space. Some will be new companies and others will be large existing businesses turning on products like Square. Some of it will be companies completely pivoting.     Business, Law, Blockchain
84    In recent weeks, there have been a number of layoffs across many industries — including crypto. To name a few, Gemini , Crypto.com and Coinbase laid off staff, adding to worry for some looking to enter (or stay) in the crypto economy.     Crypto, Economy
85    While the current crypto market is shaky, Pompliano highlighted that there are boom and bust cycles on the hiring front, too.     Crypto, Market
86   Similar to how investors get excited in boom cycles and don’t during bust moments, Pompliano said. You see that with companies too; some are hiring hundreds a year while others are doing layoffs.     Investor

115   Technology investor Anthony Pompliano has once again shared his thoughts on the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Bitcoin (BTC) on Squawk CNBC.     AI, Investor, Bitcoin, Artificial Intelligence
116   Pompliano recalled that before now, the focus of many was on Bitcoin and the general crypto ecosystem. In the present day, the attention has shifted to AI and Pompliano does not think that the pivotal is detrimental. Rather, he thinks there is a common ground of intersection for both innovative technologies to co-exist. This is a sentiment that many have not come to understand.     Crypto, AI, Bitcoin
117   When a decades-long trend is playing out, don’t get overly excited or scared based on day-to-day price movements.     General Information
118   Bitcoin is up 100% in the last year and 40% YTD.                                                         Bitcoin
119   Emotional control is key to compounding long-term.                                                       General Information
120   Precisely, the investor noted that the world is moving towards an era of automation where AI will create enormous wealth. When this era becomes a reality, Bitcoin’s responsibility would involve protecting the wealth from AI, per Pompliano’s statement. He believes that the drop in Bitcoin price is as a result of investors’ decision to put their funds on AI instead. Noteworthy, BTC was trading at $60,379.22 at the time of this writing with a 5.82% decrease in the last 24 hours.     AI, Investor, Bitcoin
121   Furthermore, Pompliano thinks that as AI expand and gets larger with more investment, investors will turn to Bitcoin. Once this happens, he sees the United States experiencing increased GDP from the productivity of AI. The capacity of Bitcoin to take part in this potential massive outlook of AI, could make the price of the coin to recover.     AI, Investor, Bitcoin
122   The tech investor highlighted the drop in BTC price, citing that it is a good time to buy more of the coin.     Investor
123   This sentiment resonates with an earlier post from author of Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert Kiyosaki. The serial entrepreneur mentioned his resolution to acquire more Bitcoin during this massive selloff period.     Bitcoin
124   Kiyosaki noted that he would rather leverage a price dip to boost his Bitcoin holdings. Hence, he is waiting to buy more Bitcoin, after which he plans to hold on to his assets forever, similar to Warren Buffet’s strategy.     Bitcoin
125   Pompliano’s talk about an intersection between AI and Bitcoin may not be far-fetched. In the last few months, there have been several integrations of AI and blockchain technology. Even Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian propagated a theory that involves the potential collision of AI and blockchain technology. He says both technologies are approaching a season when they will collide and thereafter reinforce each other.     AI, Bitcoin, Blockchain
126   Only a few weeks after the propagation of his theory, BytePlus , a unit of TikTok owner ByteDance hinted at plans to partner with Mysten Labs. This linkup is to integrate AI algorithms in the Sui Blockchain.     AI, Blockchain
