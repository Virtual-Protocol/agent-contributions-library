One of which was his interview on CNBC where the interviewer believed that people like Pompliano, who have a large following, should be held accountable and more careful with the information they share, as cryptocurrencies are a speculative asset with no backing. [31] "the problem is if you want to do and you make the analogy to various stocks you can do a fundamental analysis on a company's projected earning power over a set period of years decide what the correct valuation is to pay for that future growth you can't do any of that in crypto you can't do any of that with Bitcoin you can be a believer in blockchain technology and still think that crypto is a highly speculative asset based on next to nothing" - CNBC "don't you have any regrets whatsoever for making statements like that and perhaps putting people who are less experienced than you into some of these assets" - CNBC To which Pompliano responded with his beliefs on how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are important assets that can also be monitored and predictable	
He also carries on the interview, expressing his view on the financial state at the time which he believes is the bigger problem. [31] "You can definitely do a fundamental analysis take hash rate as an example Bitcoin is the most secure Computing Network in the world hash rates at an all-time high price is down 75 and hash rate keeps climbing" "Yeah I mean Scott you can take anything out of context I've literally recorded 1200 podcast episodes right you can go back and find all kinds of crazy stuff but the context you're talking about was I was an investor in the company in a private placement round where accredited investors evaluated a business and put capital in if something happens to a company that I'm an investor in then we lose money that is called capitalism it's called taking risk and the fact that we now want to take that and somehow spin it or pull it out of context I think is inappropriate instead what I think we should be talking about is the fact that we have businesses in the United States who now are suffering at the hands of what appears to be a potential fraud" - Anthony Pompliano He has also hosted several interviews of his own, not only covering cryptocurrencies but also controversial topics, featuring celebrities and individuals involved in controversies	businesses
