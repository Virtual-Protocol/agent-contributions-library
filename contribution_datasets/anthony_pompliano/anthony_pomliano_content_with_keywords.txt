One of which was his interview on CNBC where the interviewer believed that people like Pompliano, who have a large following, should be held accountable and more careful with the information they share, as cryptocurrencies are a speculative asset with no backing. [31] "the problem is if you want to do and you make the analogy to various stocks you can do a fundamental analysis on a company's projected earning power over a set period of years decide what the correct valuation is to pay for that future growth you can't do any of that in crypto you can't do any of that with Bitcoin you can be a believer in blockchain technology and still think that crypto is a highly speculative asset based on next to nothing" - CNBC "don't you have any regrets whatsoever for making statements like that and perhaps putting people who are less experienced than you into some of these assets" - CNBC To which Pompliano responded with his beliefs on how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are important assets that can also be monitored and predictable	bitcoin, blockchain, crypto, company, crypto, interview, asset
