The popular crypto influencer Irene Zhao now has a dedicated DAO called IreneDAO. While some have dismissed the project as a fad, it hints at a possible future where NFTs, DAOs, and social media converge. 	IreneDAO, Crypto, NFT
IreneDAO has become the talk of the crypto space after its first NFT collection soared in value on the secondary market. Irene Zhao launched the DAO to show the promise of her decentralized social media project SO-COL. Other similar NFTs have gained traction in recent months, while DAOs have also taken off. IreneDAO launched Friday and has quickly taken off.  NFT passes to enter the DAO are already trading at 1.25 Ethereum.	IreneDAO, So-Col, Crypto, NFT, Ethereum
It would appear that there's more to DAOs than acquiring valuable NFTs, the U.S  Constitution, or the Blockbuster chain-now they are starting to take the form of fan clubs. A new DAO called IreneDAO is causing a storm in the crypto world after launching Friday. The DAOis dedicated to Irene Zhao, a 28-year-old Instagram model, influencer, and cryptocurrency enthusiast who recently left her job as a commodity broker to pursue a career into the crypto industry. IreneDAO started out as a sticker collection featuring an assortment of photos of Zhao in various poses. Each photo features text overlay, often with popular crypto memes such as “WAGMI” (meaning “We’re All Going to Make It”) and “gm” (“good morning.”) The stickers were then tokenized into 1,107 NFTs, described as an access pass to the DAO’s “Genesis Tribe,” and distributed with a free mint. They’re already trading at 1.25 Ethereum on OpenSea, around $4,125 at press time. 	IreneDAO, Crypto, NFT, Ethereum,
The NFTs have become a hot topic of conversation this weekend as the prices and trading volumes have soared. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz confirmed that he’d bought one of the tokens in a Sunday tweet amid the discussions. “Proud member of team @Irenezhao_ I love the hustle.  This young woman has created her own brand in less than a year.  And NFT’s allows her to pull her community together,” he wrote. The post drew criticism from several skeptics, including Do Kwon and Daniele Sestagalli. 	NFT
SO-COL Aims to Transform Social Media. While some have dismissed Zhao's drop as another throwaway NFT collection, IreneDAO seems to have big ambitions	IreneDAO, So-Col, NFT
On Saturday, Zhao posted a tweet storm promising that there would be “lots in store” for the DAO and that it was hoping to become a “grassroots movement” for the creator economy. She added that the DAO’s core values are “Simplicity, Integrity, Meaning, and Purpose,” which is likely a subtle reference to “simp”—Internet slang for a person, usually a male, who show an excessive amount of affection to another person, usually a female, in a bid to get their attention.

Zhao rose to prominence in crypto in 2021 as the Chief Marketing Officer at Konomi Network and is currently building a decentralized social media platform called SO-COL on a StarkWare-powered Layer 2 solution. In fact, SO-COL appears to be the DAO’s core focus. SO-COL, short for “Social Collectables,” brands itself as a “decentralized version of OnlyFans, Discord, Twitch, and Patreon.” Zhao, who has a fair amount of experience in social media after building a following of 500,000 across Instagram and Twitter, told Crypto Briefing that SO-COL is aiming to be a decentralized alternative to the major social networks of Web2.

“IreneDAO started off as a social experiment to prove SO-COL’s core concept of empowering creators by connecting them with their communities via NFTs,” she said. “The ultimate goal is to create hundreds or even thousands of such communities through the SO-COL platform. The communities could be large or small, and each community, together with the creator, will define the utility of that creators’ own “collectables.”” 	IreneDAO, So-Col, Crypto, NFT, Ethereum
In other words, NFTs can be used as membership cards for communities on SO-COL, and IreneDAO is the first project that showcases its potential. SO-COL is powered by StarkWare’s Layer 2 solution StarkEx and leverages the DID protocol. 	IreneDAO, So-Col, NFT
“We are working on the technology for  SO-COL by developing our own decentralised ID (DID) protocol,” Zhao said. “At the moment, we are letting the DAO community to discuss what they want—that is the whole idea. The community and the creator will form a conversation on what value they wish to instill into the “collectables”, in this case, the IreneDAO passes.”	IreneDAO, So-Col
An NFT and DAO Explosion. While most NFTs have taken the form of tokenized JPEGs with little to offer in the way of utility to date, the concept of using them as membership cards is nothing new. Arguably the most successful NFT collection of 2021,Bored Ape Yacht Club, marketed its cartoon ape NFTs as membership passes to an exclusive club	IreneDAO, NFT
Since launching, the club has grown a thriving community, attracted the interest of celebrities like Eminem and Steph Curry, and partnered with the global brands Adidas and Universal. The team behind the collection also says a token and play-to-earn game is on the horizon. Membership passes to Bored Ape Yacht Club were available for under $200 on launch in April and now go for around $274,000 on the secondary market.	NFT
While NFTs were without a doubt the big talking point of 2021 in crypto, DAOs also started to show early promise. DAOs, otherwise known as decentralized autonomous organizations, offer a way for groups to coordinate at scale, where the rules for the are encoded in smart contracts on the blockchain.	IreneDAO, Crypto, NFT
Unlike traditional companies, there are no hierarchical structures in DAOs, at least in theory. DAOs usually have their own governance token for voting in key decisions affecting the group; a bigger allocation of tokens typically represents more voting power.	IreneDAO
In 2021, the crypto space saw a number of DAOs form with the goal of raising funds for a specific cause. PleasrDAO launched to buy a pplpleasr NFT and later acquired Wu-Tang Clan’s one-of-a-kind album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, ConstitutionDAO raised $45.6 million to buy a physical copy of the U.S. Constitution (but ultimately failed), and BlockbusterDAO formed to turn Blockbuster into a Netflix-style streaming service. In December, one DAO formed with the goal of freeing Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht from prison-it dropped $6.2 million on his first NFT collection to raise funds for Ulbricht and other prisoners. IreneDAO appears to be an early example of a fan club DAO, and potentially paves the way for a future where musicians, celebrities, and other creators leverage the blockchain to interact with their fans.

Simpin' Ain't Easy: The Business Sense Behind IreneDAO. Simplicity. Integrity. Meaning. Purpose.Apart, these are empty buzzwords	IreneDAO, SIMP
But together, they're something more: S.I.M.P., an online commandment, and the meme at the heart of a new NFT project called IreneDAO, which has become a case study in how crypto is monetizing a certain kind of obsessive relationship between fans and content creators. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. UnmuteStructurally, IreneDAO resemblesmost other pricey NFT collections: a limited set of pictures tied to tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, all sort of the same, but sort of different.	IreneDAO, Crypto, NFT, SIMP
DAO is short for “decentralized autonomous organization" an online investment club based around cryptocurrency; the tokens grant buyers access to the DAO. Each IreneDAO NFT features an image of the Singapore-based influencer Yuqing Irene Zhao, pasted onto a minty green background and flanked by popular crypto slogans.  “Damp it," reads one, referring t oa meme about the late Bogdanoff brothers	IreneDAO, Crypto, NFT
This one, in which Zhao holds up the word “simp" on a sign, recently sold for 4 ETH, or over $12,000: Simp, of course, isn't just an invented acronym. Merriam-Webster defines it (sorry) as “a stupid or foolish person," sort of like a “simpleton." But for a more precise definition of “simp” as it’s used in this context, we’re better off turning to Urban Dictionary, an online compendium of slang terms, which frames it as an explicitly gendered concept. Online, it refers to a certain kind of hardcore fan (usually a man) who goes out of their way to lavish attention on the object of their fandom (usually a woman)	Crypto, SIMP
It was originally used as an insult, since the psychology of “simping” can border on the obsessive, though simps have since attempted to reclaim the term. That's essentially what's happening with IreneDAO, and one of the reasons the lowest listed price for any of these NFTs is now 1.35 ETH, or around $4,400. Logan Paul, the YouTuber turned amateur boxer, is among the investors as is the billionaire Mike Novogratz. The images began as a sticker pack on the messenger app Telegram, as a way for Zhao and her business partner Benjamin Tang to generate buzz around the online  “Irene” persona. SO-COL, short for “social collectibles,” is the formal name for Zhao and Tang’s business. When the sticker pack took off, SO-COL decided to turn the images into an NFT collection.Like so many other NFT projects and online get-rich-quick schemes, IreneDAO managed to capture lightning in a bottle	IreneDAO, So-Col, NFT, SIMP
The rise of so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC set the stage for this sort of thing at the dawn of the 2020s, putting real value behind viral jokes. For Zhao and Tang, the self-conscious “simp" mentality is part of the brand. Simp psychology has already proved lucrative for other influencers: a streamer named Belle Delphine famously sold her bath water to fans for $30 a jar, and Stephanie Matto recently caused a stir with her “fart-in-a-jar” NFTs, which she's said can be redeemed for actual farts in actual jars	So-Col, NFT, SIMP
On the streaming platform Twitch, subscribers regularly tip their favorite gamers and commentators in the hope of getting an on-air shout-out. Those four words – simplicity, integrity, meaning, purpose – now a crucial part of SO-COL messaging, are meant to emphasize the absurdity of it all. But even if the success of IreneDAO is absurd, it's indicative of crypto's ability to quickly capitalize on hype and turn fandom into cash. Belle Delphine announced her bath water sale in 2019, well before NFTs hit the mainstream; would she have done things differently in the NFT era? “Stan culture" has normalized parasocialrelationships between fans and celebrities, with a financial componentcrypto seems poised to magnify	IreneDAO, So-Col, Crypto, NFT, SIMP
Of course, fandoms could be exploited with or without an individual influencer’s permission, as this reasoned piece from Vice explains. In the case of IreneDAO, though, things appear to have worked out. In a recentQ&A session on YouTube, Zhao explained that SO-COL could mark the beginning of a sort of “social finance," or SocialFi, application	IreneDAO, So-Col
It could work a little like a social token, where fans purchase creator coins as a form of investment in a star's popularity. “Irene DAO is just a proof of concept for SO-COL," she said, "because people [are] really skeptical about this fan economy, and whether it's really gonna be bullish in the Web 3 ecosystem."It may collapse, as NFT projects often do. But as long as simps exist, and fans continue to shovel money toward influencers for a little attention, crypto will remain a tantalizing cash grab.	IreneDAO, So-Col, Crypto, NFT
