you're not sure we have four different utilities that the people can use for only entire ecosystem of the so-called platform
So the first one is stake to unlock the SS because as we continue to develop more features of its platform, so the creators and any people who wants to launch
enough to capture and to have a set up a community on SoCo, they can stake the same tokens as a loyalty membership point, where they are taking enough tokens they can unlock additional features as like live stream
right they can increase the number of people in the chat room
and have unlocked special filters in the user interface
And also the second one is the platform governance, right
Because to promote decentralized community governance for the network, if you stake enough SIM tokens, it can allow you to propose and vote on governance proposal to determine what are the upcoming features for so-called platform
Like the priorities, the partnerships, and you can also change some important metrics of the platform
And also the third one is a community staking, because we are a decentralized platform for the creative economy, and every creator could own his community space or so called by creating NFT
So the users like the users in the community itself, they can stake
so-called simple tokens in the communities to support the creators
So if you stake enough tokens or you're like very, very highly in the entire ecosystem, we are able to increase exposure of the creators and also the community as a whole
So lastly, we have the SIM tokens to incentivize all the users to actively participate in activities and airdrops
So if you stake enough SoCo tokens, you are able to take part in platform activities, like participating in a marketing campaign to end airdrops of SIMs and other
NFT wireless or other token airdrops from the other projects
And also we will allocate available resources to improve the platform ecosystem and to promote the credit economy
Like we will have different workflow program to provide incentives for the creators to bring their friends in and also the creators to bring the fans from other social media platforms to SoCo
We are going to launch our tokens on 19th January, which is in less than a week
So, you know, you have play to earn
So SYNFY in a simple term is SIMP to earn
Because as a creator, the NFT token actually change the attention or traffic that a creator tracks to ownership
So the creators can truly own their content
So as a fan or as a follower, you are able to get a share of that ownership
You can own an Instagram post, a piece of song, or a moment in a gamer stream
And it's not really owning it, it's about investing
Because as fans, you can invest early in the creator's career
So imagine if you are always like Jeremy Lin's
game since he was in high school, and you own a piece of his clip of him dunking on somebody 15 years ago
So you can imagine how much would it be worth at the height of insanity
So let's besides generally we all can also think about J.J
Lin right he's been popular for 20 years but imagine
you have his NFT, like if he launched it like 20 years ago, and he would now say, oh, those who have my NFTs can have a basketball game with me, and I only invited those people who had my NFTs
So these are the things you can actively participate in if you are an early supporter or early owner of the NFT collection
So now imagine with all these K-pop, Japanese pop idols, they have so many fans, right
They can always give a lot of utilities like an exclusive concert
And also for the influencers, you can have a meet and greet session
For the gamers, you can have a fan-only tournament
These are all the rewards you can give to the NFT holders
And you will never have to worry about somebody just turning up at the event and claim to be a fan, because if you have NFT, everything can be tracked on the blockchain
There's no way you can fake it
So on web2, no matter how long you spend watching a YouTuber, how long you spend simping your favorite creators or your favorite girls, there's no way you can get any returns
And always people ask me like, what's the difference between NFT and OnlyFans
The thing is, no matter how long you spend
like how much time you spend on OnlyFans, how much money you spend on OnlyFans
The relationship between the creator and the fan is always transactional
You just keep giving money, right
You should keep investing
There's nothing, you can't get anything in return except all the exclusive content
But in Web3 space, if you're investing early, you can always reap the benefits together
as the creator group more popular
You can also join the growth and also show the NFT collection, show the creator, show the community together with other people
So these are the rewards you can get if they become popular, if the community become bigger
So more people will demand NFTs
And of course, the price of NFT will go up and the value also goes up
So you can never achieve this with the only Web2 technology
So these are the same five we are talking about
