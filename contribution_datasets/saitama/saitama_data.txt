Having apparently trained himself so hard that he unintentionally gained strength that goes beyond superhuman level, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroics. He is registered with the Heroes Association as a B-Class Superhero (A-Class after Monster Association Arc) and is tasked to defend Z-City against mysterious beings. He is voiced byMakoto Furukawain the original Japanese version and byMax Mittelmanin the English dub. The latter provided the voices ofArataki IttoinGenshin Impact,Kira YamatoinMobile Suit Gundam SEED,Inaho KaizukainAldnoah Zero,Logix FiscarioinAtelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky,KadeninFire Emblem Fates,RyujifromPersona 5. Saitama is a slim, bald man with average eyes. He notably wears a yellow jumpsuit, with a black belt, round, gold buckle, white collar, short zip, red gloves, red boots and a cape (red in the manga, white in the anime) that is attached by dark grey buttons. Saitama is drawn in a simpler style than other characters in the series, having an oval-shaped face, and a simple mouth and eyes. However, when drawn in a more serious style, with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features and a muscular body. Saitama initially had messy, black hair and brown eyes, but claims to have lost all of his hair, suddenly, as a result of his intense hero training."	Hence his moniker, Saitama is the titular character of One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the entire franchise. So far no enemy has been able to injure him in any way and almost no enemy is even able to survive a single earnest punch from him. The origin of Saitama's immeasurable power remains mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all. According to Saitama, after a year and half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.	According to the official databook:What he likes is seaweed, Chinese cabbage, and new products of dubious value.
