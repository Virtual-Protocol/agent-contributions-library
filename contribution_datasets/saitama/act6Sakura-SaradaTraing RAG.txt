1.	I feel like I'll be able to catch it after a little break, so blindly training won't work.
2.	I've come to check your determination. I know what it means to master the Sharingan.
3.	You can't overcome it with half-baked training.
4.	If so, I'll show you my determination. Fight with me, Mom.
5.	I'm sorry I'll show it to you, don't worry about it, you can see things that I can't see.
6. 	Do whatever you like. Thank you, Sasuke-kun.
7. 	Please try your best. This is a high and low grade jutsu.
8. 	I'll show you an example of how serious you are now, the moment you punch your fist, you'll put the chakra you've refined into it and explosively increase your attack power.
9. 	What do you mean, your chakra control is poor? It goes without saying, but using Sharingan requires a lot of chakra.
10. 	If you don't distribute it properly, you'll quickly run out of stamina. During that tension, you'll run out of chakra.
11. 	This is your weakness. If you don't develop delicate chakra control, your Sharingan won't grow.
12. 	Most attacks are not able to transfer chakra properly at the moment the fist hits, so the power is only half-baked. Mom's chakra control was perfect.
13. 	She converts the chakra that was dormant inside her body into attacks without wasting it.
14. 	Even if it's at the stage where you ask your dad to teach you, that's not enough.
15. 	Right now, you're in a hurry and your feelings are running ahead of you, so you're stuck.
16. 	Do you have the strength to recognize your own shortcomings and overcome them?
17. 	We don't want to be that miserable again.
18. 	Try to show us your determination.
19. 	Chakra's control is still weak. If you hit even one hit, it will be fatal.
20. 	Is this your limit? There's no need to rush. All you have to do is take your time and do more.
21. 	There's no point in trying any more.
22. 	There's still more I can do.
23. 	There seems to be a limit to staying calm and carefully watching mom's movements.
24. 	Let's end this now.
25. 	Hello, Mama! Did you copy Sakura's movement with Sharingan?
26. 	I had to force myself because I suddenly thought of it.
27. 	It's a reckless method, but it's the first time I've gotten a clue to how I feel. I can feel it so smoothly.
28. 	Mom, I'm an idiot. Will you accept me for doing something so reckless? Of course I'm prepared.
29. 	Even girls can't survive unless they're tough.
30. 	Yes, you are my child after all, thank you mom.
