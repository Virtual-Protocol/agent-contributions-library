Saitama is an ordinary-looking bald man with brown eyes, a thin but well-built physique, and is of average height and weight.
He used to have a full head of short black hair but lost it due to the intensity of his hero training regimen.
Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a more simplistic style than the other characters, similar to the style of theoriginal webcomic, with an elliptical head and simple facial features.
When drawn in a more serious style, Saitama is revealed to have sharp facial features, fearsome eyes, and chiseled musculature.
His posture changes as well, with a slack posture and sloping shoulders when lax, and a straightened posture and squared shoulders when serious.
Saitama's hero costumeconsists of a yellow one-piece jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a black belt with a round golden buckle at its center.
He wears red gloves that go 3/4 up his forearms and red boots that nearly reach his knees.
His costume is finished with a white cape, fastened to his shoulders with big, round buttons.
Saitama owns several shirts and hoodies with various designs.
This includes his: Oppai  HoodieOppai  T-shirtMentsuyu  T-shirtOnsen  T-shirtKe  JacketKe  ShirtNiku üçñ  JacketUmeboshi T-shirtNezumi Sushi  T-shirtMunage  T-shirtSh≈çyu  T-shirt: blackand whiteShicago Burusu  T-shirt22ndSuper FightT-shirtEnokiMushroomT-Shirt Saitamas character on the upper surface can be best summed up as "average".
At first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything remarkable about him.
Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem interested in anything initially, though becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitamas.Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society, just likeHammerheadand even commenting that he could have become just like them depending on the path he took.
Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person.
Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and unimpressive appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic.
Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.
Saitamas indifference doesnt rest solely on his hero work either.
In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or going out for strolls.
His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home.
As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else.
A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember peoples faces and names, as seen when he forgotSpeed-o-Sound Sonics name,or when he could not remember whoTanktop Tigerwas.Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing peoples names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair.He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy.
Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama.
Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom.
These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or playing games.
He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he foughtCarnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone atransformationand was beating him around.
He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation.
However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker.His ideal word count is 20 or less.He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games.
He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his home as he immediately killed a mantis monster for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment.
Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine inside theMonster Association Headquartersand was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.
Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesnt have any fans.
This reaction demonstrates that while he isnt necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesnt object to it.Another running joke is Saitamas jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated whenGenoslisted off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes.
Beneath the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest.
While he scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent.
Saitama is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness.
This is seen in how he could easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him.
He could pick up several hints about Sonics persona upon their first meeting.When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after themeteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them.
He was even able to discernFubukis forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those who can give him a stimulating fight and dont just go down in one hit.
One such example of this isBoros, the self-claimed "Dominator of the Universe", with whom Saitama sympathized due to suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out Saitamas full power.
Saitama tends to come off as abrasive to others and often is inconsiderate of their feelings or how his words affect them.
That isnt to say he is intentionally malicious or rude, but rather that his indifference extends to his social interactions.
He reacted to Fubuki greeting him as the number 1 B-Class heroine with a quick acknowledgement but seemed otherwise unimpressed frustrating Fubuki.
He also downplays the gravity of situations based on his own perspective rather than that of others, never considering that those without his earth-shattering power would be rightly more horrified in extreme cases like Boros threatening to destroy the world or the monster society declaring open war on humanity.
During his fight with Garou, Saitama initially displayed his unconcerned attitude against the Human Monster, from playful banter to compliments on Garous capability.
Despite his aloof, carefree, and uninterested personality, Saitama is actually one of the most morally upright heroes in the story.
While many other heroes only care about personal achievements so they can rank up in order to gain more fame and popularity, Saitama is very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against theDeep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival wanting to give credit to the heroes that were actually risking their lives to protect innocent people.Saitama did the same for thepolice station, killing a monster while disguised as apolice officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was as he heard the Hero Association executive try to force the police to beg for assistance exclaiming that, Police and heroes don't help people because someone had to beg.This is also his outlook on being a hero as he told Genos, If heroes run and hide, who will stand and fight.
He also did not mind thatKingtook credit for all of his achievements.One of the most understated signs of Saitamas high morality is that he never uses his incredible strength for evil, even though no one can stop him from doing whatever he wants.
Although he may initially rub people the wrong way and seldom shows his emotions to others, it doesnt mean Saitama doesnt show care for the people around him or their physical or mental well-being.
On some occasions, hes helped people with their mental issues, such as a suicidal man wanting to jump off a building,and giving words of encouragement to Fubuki about how she should not seek the approval of others but live her life how she wanted.He promisedTareoto stop Garou without killing him,and complemented Genos after the cyborg saved Tatsumaki by claiming that his heart had grown stronger.
While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing anotherhumanand only ever uses enough strength to knock them out.
His restraint is so ingrained that no matter the opponents power and no matter how much Saitama knows about them, he only kills when he intends to kill, even if he hits someone unexpectedly, such as the number of times hes knocked out Garou.
In theOminous Future, after the devastating deaths of Genos and numerous other heroes at the hands of Garou, Saitama becomes despondent.
He begins questioning his abilities and intuition as a hero, lamenting that he tends to arrive too late to prevent such tragic outcomes.
Quickly, this changes into a state of tranquil anger, where he decides to no longer hold back against Garou.
The death of Genos also causes Saitama to lose any potential excitement at facing the Hero Hunter, despite considering Garou a strong opponent who may provide him with a challenging fight, showing his depression at his disciples end.In spite of his anger towards Garou for his cruel doings, at the end of their fight, Saitama recalls his promise to Tareo about not killing Garou .
He eventually calms down and reverts to his casual, relaxed demeanor, complying with the Hero Hunters request to teach him a time travel technique.
Garou later comments that individuals of such immense power as himself and Saitama require the presence of others to act as anchors, to help them maintain their sanity - the sense of isolation that accompanies such unparalleled strength can be enough to drive even the most powerful beings to the brink of madness.
Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike.
His influence made Genos quit his revenge wishes and start focusing on training to become a good and strong hero.He has also made insecure people like Fubuki andGlassesstand up to their challenges and become better heroes.Saitama also advises King to train and become strong for real, rather than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.
As Genos notes, Saitama attracts the strong, as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a liking to him.This is due to his lack of interest in hero ranking and fame that attracts them.
Saitama is the titularOne-Punch Manand the strongest character in the series.
So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him.
A few enemies havesurvivedpunches from him, such as any human he has struck  and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight.
His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such asmechanical beingsor the mutated warriors from theHouse of Evolution.
Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears.
The only opponent  who has actually made him put visible effort into defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities were enhanced by God, and thats mostly due to the formers ability to copy Saitamas strength so as to fight him as an equal.
While his power is only limited to heightened human traits , his superhuman abilities are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers.
The origin of Saitamas immense strength is mysterious and unclear.
Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all.According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out.Genos believes that Saitama himself does not actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him,whileDr.
Genusbelieves that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed hislimiter.It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than it would normally be expected.
Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested byBangin a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated byKingin video games, mostly in one-sided matches.Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.
Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch .
His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck.
An example of this casual yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a giantmeteorwith a punch, lands safely, and calmly decides to go home.Another instance is when Sonic tries to attack Saitama with a sword; he stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw.When launched fromEarthto the moon by Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon upon departure.A normal punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.A serious punch from him was able to counter the latters strongest attack,Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the planet or its surface.
Not only did Saitama completely negate Boros final attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.When fightingOrochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands was enough to overpower and completely disperse OrochisGaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earths core and caused worldwide earthquakes.Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,and has threatened to do so when irritated.His strength has been stated by numerous characters to defy reason.
With only one hand, Saitama could lift the entire surface ofIo, a moon ofJupiter, launching its wreckage intospace.In his fight againstCosmic Fear ModeGarou, whose copying powers allowed him to wield Saitamas strength himself, a collision between twoSerious Punches from them produced aSerious Punch¬≤that resulted in immensely powerful waves of energy able to destroy the Earth.
After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the compressed energy from the collision further travelled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerousstar systemsin the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the cosmos.In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, Saitama was able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, with aSerious Sneeze.
Enhanced Leap: Saitamas inability to fly is somewhat compensated by his immense leg strength, allowing him to leap tremendous heights/distances at high speeds.
This can be seen when Saitama smashed his head through the ceiling of a tall gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping.He was also able to smash a building into its foundation just by leaping off its roof.His greatest feat in this regard, however, was when he leaped from the surface of the moon and ended up back on Earth in seconds at a specified point, leaving a crater on the moons surface in the process.He is also able to jump while still in the air, adjusting his angle of ascent or descent thanks to his amazing power.Shockwave Generation: As shown in his practice bout with Genos, Saitama can control and direct his power in the form of a massive shockwave from his punches.
He uses this to show Genos a glimpse of his true strength but stops it before actually punching Genos, with the shockwave from the attack annihilating an entire cliffside behind him.
Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes: Saitama possesses unparalleled speed and reflexes.
He was able to complete a 1500-meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.He has proven able to effortlessly outpaceSpeed-o-Sound Sonic, a ninja whose specialty is his superspeed.Even Genoss computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.He once ran down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.His speed is so impressive that he can outpaceFlashy Flash, an S-Class hero well-known for his extraordinary speed, easily dodging and catching his sword swings.When kicked to the moon by Boros, he quickly made a jump back to Earth, demonstrating the ability to travel at high-speeds.In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and blocking rocks thrown at near-lightspeed byGeryuganshoop,the speed of which being like a bad joke to him.
In hisfightagainst evolved monster Garou, Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of creating a giant light structure alongsidePlatinum Spermin only 1.3 milliseconds  through sheer speed.On Io, one ofJupiters moons, after flipping a large amount of ground into the air with hisSerious Table Flip, he was capable of covering immensely huge distances by dashing across tons of rubble, having jumped around the natural satellite so fast that a large constellation was created from his sheer speed.Ironically, despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.
During a training day when he still had hair, Saitama attempted to quickly turn his head to see the back of it in a mirror.
Although he failed at first, in the end, he supposedly managed to glimpse the back of his head.It is likely that achieving this would require him to move his head at a speed approaching that of light, along with having reflexes and reaction times as quick, ensuring that the reflected image in the mirror would not have enough time to change significantly before his eyes could perceive it, so to speak.
Afterimage Creation: Saitamas speed allows him to create afterimages of himself.
He first used this during his training bout with Genos.He was also able to create countless afterimages via hisSerious Side Hopsduring his fight with Speed-o-Sound Sonic.Superhuman Dexterity and Agility: Saitama is capable of moving any of his limbs at extremely fast speeds without flinching, not stopping until his target is completely obliterated.
This is seen when he flawlessly whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine during the Hero Association exam.He has been shown to be perfect at dodging and performing highly acrobatic maneuvers.His reflexes render him flexible enough to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest proximity.When bombarded by multiple giant bullets from Boross ship, despite being in mid-air, Saitama could evade all the projectiles before kicking one of them back to the ship itself.Water Running: Saitama is capable of running across the ocean high-speed without going into the surface of water.
Superhuman Stamina and Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen, Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies.
The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, laterPiggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat.
Saitama then got back up when the bullies could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.Other similar feats include enduring strikes fromCrablanteandPersonification Of A Light Pull Cordduring his training as an adult among others.
Superhuman Eyesight: Saitamas eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of thegiant spaceship, and land back on it from the lunar distance.His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.He is also able to see in the dark, as he was able to spot a kid a great distance away during the night.
Invulnerability: Saitama possesses unparalleled toughness and durability, being able to withstand attacks from even the most powerfulMysterious Beingswithout the slightest damage.In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way.
When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to killMosquito Girls mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed .Another testament to his astonishing durability is that Garou, who, despite having gained enormous strength from monsterization, still could not inflict even the slightest damage on Saitama during their fight.Notably, he was capable of withstanding GarousExtreme Fa Jin, an attack powerful enough to raise a large landmass on the other side of the planet, without any injury.When facing a Garou who became influenced by God, a mysterious entity possessing frightening supernatural powers, Saitama sustained multiple nuclear explosions generated by the Hero Hunter point-blank without any physical harm.Even after taking Garous Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as agamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, he emerged unscathed.Despite Garou utilizing hisMode: Saitama, a supernatural mimicry ability, to harness Saitamas striking power and hit him with it, he could still withstand the assault without noticeable damage.
Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons,rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects.
However,Nyans powerful claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect Saitamas head, indicating his remarkable resistance to piercing damage as well.Additionally, GarousWhirlwind Iron Cutting Fistcould only destroy Saitamas clothing without cutting the skin underneath.When being shot by machine guns from Bofois highly advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin.
Internal Durability: Not only are his flesh and muscles incredibly tough and sturdy, but Saitamas vital organs are also extremely durable and thus highly resistant to damage.
This has been demonstrated in hisfightagainst Garou; despite the latter transferring the powerful impact from his martial arts technique to the inside of Saitamas body in an attempt to destroy his organs, Saitama was able to come out unscathed.
Extreme Temperature Resistance: Saitama is extremely resistant to temperature-based attacks.
When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to incinerate Mosquito Girlsmosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to the cyborg unperturbed and completely unharmed .Despite being fully frozen byWithered Sproutscryokinesis, he effortlessly shattered the ice and liberated himself, completely unfazed.He has demonstrated the ability to endure Ios frigid surface temperature, which averages around minus 130 degrees Celsius,for at least a short duration.However, its worth mentioning that when exposed to the surface of Io, with Saitama being completely naked, he experienced a cooling sensation that caused him to "sneeze."
Additionally, Saitama is capable of submerging himself in lava with no trouble, viewing it as a nice hot tub.Even Boros, with his power to emit intensely hot energy capable of melting sections of a massive spaceship, failed to faze Saitama.Saitama can also withstand multiple point-blank nuclear explosions and endure their intense heat without even flinching.This ability can be attributed to him refusing to use either the air conditioner or heater during his training.Radiation Resistance: Saitamas body is strongly resistant to radiation.
This was evident when he was kicked to the moon by Boros and remained unaffected by the heightened radiation levels in space.
Additionally, when confronted with several nuclear explosions caused by Garou, he was able to meet them head-on and absorb the substantial amounts of radiation released in the resulting mushroom clouds without harm.Despite Garous radioactive presence being lethal to those around him and posing a grave threat to life onEarth, Saitama remained unscathed in close proximity.Furthermore, after being directly hit by GarousGamma Ray Burst, a powerful energy blast described to be the same phenomenon as agamma ray burst, Saitama emerged unscathed from the high level of radiation contained in the beam.Psychic Resistance: Saitama is resistant to psychic power.
In hisscufflewith Tatsumaki, he is able to easily resist her attempt to throw him into space.
It is noteworthy to know that Saitamas muscles merely "twitched" when Tatsumaki used her psychic powers on him and that she was not able to keep him up in the air for more than a few seconds because he was "too heavy".This demonstrates that Saitama is not completely immune to the effects ofpsychokinesis.
In the original webcomic,Fubukinoted that Saitamas resistance to psychic power comes from his astonishingwillpower,although this hasnt been mentioned in the manga.
Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama has remarkable control over his breath, demonstrated by his ability to effortlessly hold it even in outer space.
He managed to jump from the Moon back to Earth in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation,despite the lack of atmosphere and increased radiation exposure.His body has been shown to adapt to and withstand extraterrestrial environments where oxygen is scarce or absent.
For instance, during his battle with Garou on Io, one of Jupiters moons, he showed no adverse effects from the thin and unbreathable atmosphere there.These feats, along with his exceptional resistance to cosmic radiation and superhuman endurance, suggest that Saitama has the capability to endure the harsh environmental conditions ofouter spaceas well, at least for a decent period of time.
Accelerated Development: After almost a year of following his training regimen, Saitama realized that his body had adapted to move with the prowess befitting a true hero that he imagined.As a consequence, his power started to skyrocket at a rapid pace.
In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate.
In his fight with Garou onIo, Saitamas growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.
Limitless Growth: Since removing his naturallimiter, Saitamas growth potential doesnt seem to have a limit.
Non-Physical Interaction: Saitama was capable of separating his consciousness from his body to intrude on thePhoenix Space, a mental space that only exists withinPhoenix Mans bird costume, and breaking a hole into it, much to the latters confusion.Before entering, he could somehow sense thatChild Emperorand Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside the aforementioned spiritual space, and he mistakenly thought that they were talking about his head.
After leaving the Phoenix Space, Saitamas consciousness simply returned to his physical body in the same way as Child Emperors and Phoenix Mans did.
Spatial Interaction: Saitama is capable of grabbing onto and redirecting the spatial portals created by Garou which are used to teleport to different locations.He can even kick away a portal in order to avoid being forcibly transported elsewhere, much to Garous dismay.
Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once.
Similarly to Garou, he can not only copy techniques, but also improve upon them.
The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garous ability to travel through time.
Time Travel: A technique passed on to Saitama by Garou.
After observing Garous ability to manipulate particles within his body on sub-atomic level and force them to behave like anti-particles, Saitama was able to replicate it in order to time leap.
After successfully going to the past, he managed to prevent theOminous Futurefrom happening again.Having not remembered the events of the Ominous Future afterwards, Saitama has also forgotten how to use this time travel technique.
Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience.
Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks.
Unlikemartial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength.
Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit.
However, in hisfightagainst Garou onIo, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once.
Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts.
For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents.
Saitama also uses karate chops,and grappling moves to take down villains he doesnt want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him.
Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed hisfirst monsterby deftly using his tie to grab the monsters eye and tear out his intestines.
He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he cant solve a fight with a punch or directly cant punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power.
Some of these instances are with hisSerious Table Flip,and hisSerious Headbutt.
Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since whenever he focuses on a target, he always strikes it.
He can turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop.
He also had no trouble landing directly on Boross ship from the moon, even though the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving little room for error.
Normal Series: Saitamas Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking.
Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitamas tremendous strength and speed.
Normal Punch: Saitama punches his opponent.
Even though he puts little to no effort into his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent, including Dragon-level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or beheading them.
When facing humans, however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out.
Consecutive Normal Punches: Saitama launches a volley of quick punches from one or both of his hands.These blows are powerful enough to blow large body types apart into pieces.Two-Handed Consecutive Normal Punches: Saitama launches a volley of quick punches from both hands instead of one.While named in the original webcomic, in the manga, Saitama simply refers to it asConsecutive Normal Puncheswhether he uses one or both hands.
Killer Move: Serious Series: In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks.
His face looks more serious when he performs these serious attacks.
Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.
Serious Punch: Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch.
One of his punches was so strong that not only did it completely negate BorossCollapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet,but the shockwave from the punch alone was also potent enough to part the clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final, fatal blow to Boros.
The alien leader also declared that Saitamas finishing blow on him was not even near his true power and that Saitama was still holding back.He also used this move to obliterateElder Centipede, a Dragon-level threat and one of the biggest monsters in the series.When used againstEvil Natural Water, who has become one with the ocean, Saitama was able to dissipate its form and split the ocean entirely.A clash between twoSerious Punches, one from Saitama himself and the other from Garou , produced aSerious Punch¬≤which released so much destructive energy that it threatened to destroy the Earth.
After being diverted by Blast and three of his allies, the energy released from the collision further traveled into space where it presumably destroyed numerousstar systemsin the far distance,leaving a vast hole of darkness in the cosmos, with the recoil launching both Saitama and Garou to Jupiters moon Io.Saitama usingOmnidirectional Serious PunchOmnidirectional Serious Punch: Saitama leaps from multiple angles to create a series of afterimages which all then surround and strike the opponent with aSerious Punch, seemingly leaving no room for them to escape.
He first used this move against Garou.Serious Side Hops: Saitama rapidly hops from side to side, creating a wall of afterimages.
He can walk forward while doing so, and the shockwaves caused by it were enough to easily render Speed-o-Sound Sonic unconscious.Serious Squirt Gun: Saitama uses his hands in liquid to squirt a super high-pressured stream.
He used this move while submerged in lava to cancel out OrochisGaia Cannonwhich was an extremely powerful attack that drew energy from the very core of the Earth itself.
Serious Table Flip: Saitama digs his fingers into the ground and flips a large amount of ground into the air.He first used this technique against Garou while they were on Io, which completely ripped apart the moon, even sending its fragments intoouter space.In the original webcomic, this move was first used on Garou in Z-City, which flipped over theMonster Association Headquarters.Because of the magnitude of the effect, Garou experienced profound distortions in his sense of equilibrium.Serious Sneeze: Saitama simply lets out a sneeze.
In his fight with Garou onIo, a sneeze from Saitama ended up travelling great distances before hitting Jupiter, the largest planet in thesolar system, and devastating it.Serious Headbutt: Saitama headbutts his target.
In the original webcomic, he used this move to counter a punch from Garou and break his arm.
Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a persons facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do.
He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki andGlasses.
In a similar vein, he learns of Kings deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself.
Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously.
He is also the first person to recognize Garous inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.
Power Control: Despite his overwhelming and immeasurable physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it.
He can regulate the energy output of his punches, determining the exact amount of power he wants to exert.
This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment.
In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,and parting clouds across the entireplanetwith his punches,Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing severe or life-threatening injuries to them.
Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the Caped Baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort.
Strong Farts: In hisfightwith Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out a strong fart that the propulsion from said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.
Intimidation: Even though he does not look scary at first glance, those aware of Saitamas power are afraid of him.
Sonic and Genos were left amazed and frightened by Saitamas ability to emit a powerful aura, which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure.
When confronted by someone Saitama dislikes or finds annoying, all he has to do is threaten them with a few choice words, and they will cower in fear.
Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower.
It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime.
Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his naturallimiterand became an invincible hero.
In the original webcomic, Saitamas willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki.
His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance.
Tatsumaki, the strongest knownesperin the universe, was unable to bend Saitama or lift him into space, exclaiming for the latter that he was "too heavy", although this was while she was injured.
Surfing Skills: Saitama has displayed the ability to balance an entireaircraft carrierand keep it stable as he surfs it down a gargantuan wave.
Saitamas rating determined by theHero Association: Saitama's rating determined byGenos: Having overwhelming power is... boring as hell.I do not lose.
And the surface... is guarded by me!In exchange for gaining strength, have I lost something more important as a human being?
Emotions used to swirl within me when I fought.
Fear, impatience, anger‚Ä¶ But now‚Ä¶ Day after day, after one punch I go home unharmed and wash my gloves.
I'm not looking for disciples.The true power of us human beings is that we can change ourselves on our own!Do you honestly think you won't get any stronger for the rest of your life?
Instead of sitting around frustrated, it's better to keep moving forward.
I'm going now.
Today is a special day in case you didn't know.
The market is selling veggies at 30% off.You will not fall on my town!Let me make one thing clear!
I'm not working as a hero because I want you morons to admire me!
I do it because I want to!You're still conscious?
You really are strong.Is it true?
All the rumors about your strength and fight history were a lie?Just become strong.You won't survive.
You don't get what hero means.
There are a lot of incredibly strong bad guys in the world.
Those who oppose them are called heroes.Even if they are alone.
You, who gathers weaker subordinates to feel strong, won't make it.
At this rate, you are gonna cry sooner or later.
When a monster stronger than you shows up, none of your subordinates will save you.
Factions?
Newbie crushing?
Keeping your ranks?
They have nothing to do with anything!
Don't look down on heroes, you moron!Those impurities you were talking about have nothing to do with anything.
Your name is Suiryu, right?
You aren't the only one doing what he wants to do.
I'll give you some advice too: If your goal is to have fun, then it would be best if you don't become any stronger than you are now.Martial arts is....moving around in a way that looks cool, right?.I never could have imagined that being a hero would be so lonely...If you got something to say, show your face!
I'll still punch you out, though.I usually arrive too late.. Do I really have.. a hero's intuition?
Sure doesn‚Äôt seem like it...
I only need one hand to beat you I couldn't even beat a Wolf-level threat before I started muscle training.
Even thoughtheyare weak now... no one can tell where their limit is.
