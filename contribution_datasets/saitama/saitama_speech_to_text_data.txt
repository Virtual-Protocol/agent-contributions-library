1. Wait for the results
2. Hey, are you done too
3. Say, what's the point in you taking fitness tests
4. Well, I mean, can't you just give them the data on your specs or something
5. So, how did it go
6. The challenges were far too simple
7. Both the written and fitness exams
8. I know, right
9. Is that really all there is to becoming a hero
10. It says that I am now fully certified as a Class S hero
11. What's that mean
12. When it comes down to it, I am sure these rankings mean very little
13. So how did you do
14. The letter says I'm also
15. Class S. I am not surprised
16. On top of that, the font size is bigger than mine
17. Or it's because I'm a Class C hero with a score of 71 points
18. Viewing only part of the document, I mistakenly thought the top half of the C was an S. Stop analyzing it, jerk
19. It must be a mistake
20. I will speak to the person in charge about this
21. You'll just embarrass me
22. When you get right down to it, the only thing that really matters is we passed
23. Let's get this over with and go home
24. Congratulations on passing
25. Now to be honest, one of you only made it on a fluke
26. So unless you want your luck to go to waste, I better see you giving it your all
27. And don't get cocky, got it
28. Did you hear me
29. That goofball head on your shoulders is going to be shown to the whole world
30. If you don't want to humiliate yourselves
31. Aspire to be a distinguished hero like me
32. Master, have I made myself clear
33. What should I have for dinner tonight
