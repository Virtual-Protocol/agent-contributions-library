1	Something tells me a whole lot of people are about to die
2	Hey guys, sorry I'm late
3	Had to go number two
4	Oh, so sorry
5	Why yes, yes you can
6	I'm here to report a terrible crime
7	Carry it for who
8	This is so frustrating
9	He just told me I have to carry this javelin for a reason, but he didn't say why
10	Oh, God, stop
11	You're gonna do that thing where you open up a weird-ass case of torture devices while inexplicably detailing your master plan and how I don't fit into it
12	Seriously, you don't have to
13	You're building a criminal empire because Daddy kicked you out of Janus Corp
14	And you think this is a big funky, but in actuality, it's a very misguided attempt to win back his respect
15	I get it
16	You're really not as complicated as you think
17	Oh, Jesus Christmas
18	Now you're going to say that you want to kill me to set an example
19	What are you guys doing
20	You were going to save me
21	Well, I can go back inside and you can still do it
22	What was that
23	I should kill everyone and escape
24	Sorry, the voices
25	I'm kidding, jeez
26	That's not what they really said
27	There are two ways that diamond's coming out of you
28	This way or this way
29	I don't remember any Milton
30	Somebody named Milton has been with us the whole time
31	Oh, that guy
32	I could be your friend, Milton
33	What are you talking about
34	We've just had a conversation for, like, three hours about how your name is Milton
35	They say, if you want to tell a story right, you've got to start at the beginning
36	This is me, Harleen Quinzel
37	When I was a kid, my dad traded me for a six-pack of beer
38	But however many times he tried to ditch me, I kept coming back
39	Eventually, he found me a new home
40	The good sisters of St
41	Bernadette's taught me a lot
42	I was never an establishment kind of gal
43	All things considered, I did good
44	I even went to college
45	Got my PhD
46	Had my heart broken once or twice
47	Finding love is not easy
48	So I threw myself into my work
49	Became a psychiatrist
50	That's when I met him
51	Mr. J. My Joker
52	Oh, I fell hard
53	Like, out of a plane without a parachute right in your dumb fucking face kind of hard
54	I lost all sense of who I was
55	I only had eyes for Puddin'
56	We all know the saying, behind every successful man, there's a badass broad
57	Well, that was me
58	I was the brains behind some of Mrs. J's greatest stunts
59	Not that he let anyone know it
60	I guess all good things have to come to an end
61	So, we broke up
62	I handled it real mature, but Mr. J was super broke up about it
63	I got an amazing new place that was all mine
64	It gave me the space to really reflect on the mistakes of my past
65	I had to find a new identity
66	A new me
67	It wasn't easy
68	But after a while, I even opened myself up to the possibility of new love
69	Here's the thing about new love
70	You have to feed it
71	Soon enough, I was back on my feet, ready to move on, to make new friends
72	It was time for Gotham to meet the new Harley Quinn
73	So I really put myself out there
74	Call me dumb
75	I have a PhD, motherfucker
76	Recently, I made a promise to myself that the next time I got a boyfriend, I'd be on the lookout for red flags
77	And if I saw any, I would do the healthy thing
78	And I would murder him
79	I know, I know, I know what you're trying to say
80	Harley, why not just leave
81	And I'd say, why are you screaming at me
82	I'm not deaf
83	I'm standing right here
84	Then I'd say, when your taste in men is as bad as mine
85	They don't just go away quietly
86	They'd slash your tires and they'd kill your dogs and tell you that the music you like ain't real music at all and all the cruelty tears you apart after a while
87	You were real pretty and all
88	to that absolutely beautiful monster between your legs but all in all
89	I think you're more pretty like this
90	With all those rotten thoughts empty from your head
91	I'm the one they should be scared of
92	Not you, not Mr. J. Because I'm Harley fucking Quinn
93	Harley Quinn, nice to meet ya
94	I like what you're selling, lady
95	You're my friend, too
96	That's just one teeny problem
97	You messed with my friend
98	That felt pretty great
