1. I think everyday for me is a really fantastic day when I'm working for Binance
2. Actually, we're not just working for a job
3. I think we are really changing the world
4. And if you ask me which day is most impressed me, I think that's the first day because I want to keep my day one moment and keep build, keep passion, keep the very simple mindset and build everything for the community
5. Actually six years is really long, but what can we do in the future
6. We will continue to build this industry as the last six years
7. First part, we will continue to build this exchange part
8. We definitely believe the regulator will help more people know about our industry and really rise to a big industry
9. So that's a
10. Another part is we will continue to support a lot of founders successful in our industry and if you are a founder and really have a strong power, please don't give up whatever is world market or bear market
11. I want to thank our community members for the last six years of supporting Binance going to today
12. I definitely believe that's because our community members support us, so we get kind of successful
13. But it's just the beginning
14. I want our community members to continue to support Binance
15. We will, like the day one, continue to build our industry, and let's build together
