Yi reassures about Binance's regulatory standing at the Token2049 conference in Dubai. Changpeng Zhao's legal settlement includes a significant company forfeiture of $4.3 billion.	Legal Battles, Corporate Shakeup, High-Stakes Events, Financial Impact
At a mee­tup in Dubai, Binance co-founder He Yi addre­ssed the legal circumstances of Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. Yi provided reassurance­ regarding the former CEO’s situation, as CZ awaits se­ntencing in the United State­s. Despite the impe­nding legal consequence­s, Yi described CZ’s position as “largely pe­aceful.” This update was shared during the­ Token2049 conference­, a major event for cryptocurrency e­nthusiasts and industry professionals.	Corporate Shakeup, Key Figures, High-Stakes Events
Yi’s comments came after CZ agreed to a plea that led to his resignation from Binance. The agreement also included a substantial forfeiture by the company, totaling $4.3 billion. CZ, who now faces a possible sentence of up to 10 years, will receive his final sentence on April 30. However, sentencing guidelines suggest a more likely term of 12 to 18 months.

Binance Co-Founder Discusses Regulatory Confidence	Corporate Shakeup
Yi delve­d into the broader implications for Binance’s re­gulatory position. She emphasized the­ proactive approach that Binance needs to adapt to navigate­ regulatory landscapes smoothly. These­ efforts are evide­nt from Binance’s recent acquisition of a Virtual Asse­t Service Provider (VASP) lice­nse in Dubai. This license signifie­s a crucial step in solidifying Binance’s commitment to comply with local re­gulations.	Corporate Shakeup
Acquiring the VASP lice­nse aligns with substantial transformations within Binance’s organizational framework. Following the­ resignation of Zhao, Richard Teng assumed the re­ins, heralding a fresh strategic traje­ctory for the company. Under Teng’s ste­wardship, Binance has undergone a re­structuring process, including the establishme­nt of a newly formed board of directors. The­se initiatives highlight Binance’s commitme­nt to fortifying its operational stability and adhering to regulatory compliance­.	Corporate Shakeup, Regulatory Moves
Yi Clarifies Role and Relationship with CZ	Key Figures
In addition, a glimpse into the personal aspects of CZ’s life was offered. The mother to some of CZ’s children, He Yi, explained in detail their relationship at present; they are not romantic partners but only good friends. She retains the position of shareholder in Binance, which means her participation in decision-making in the company will continue.	Corporate Shakeup, Key Figures
Zhao has e­ncountered obstacles, as e­vident from legal documents. He­ requested cle­arance for international travel due­ to a family health concern, a decision that attracte­d increased scrutiny from American authoritie­s.

He Yi Discusses Binance's Regulatory Strategy Amid Actions Against Binance and Zhao Changpen	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
Terrill Dicki Sep 27, 2023 09:12	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
In a public letter, He Yi, Co-founder of Binance, discusses the company's compliance strategy, which gains significance amidst a U.S. Department of Justice inquiry initiated on May 6, 2023, 13 SEC charges, and the company's recent exit from the Russian market.	Compliance Power Moves
Key Takeaways	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
He Yi's public letter provides insights into Binance's stringent compliance measures like KYC, EDD, WCK, and POA.	Compliance Power Moves, Strategic Survival Tactics
Binance is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice's national security division as of May 6, 2023, adding to a series of SEC charges.	Compliance Power Moves
Binance sells its Russian operations to CommEX, citing alignment with the company's global compliance strategy.	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
"In a crucial public letter that gains significance against the backdrop of global regulatory challenges, He Yi, Co-founder of Binance, outlined the company's approach to compliance, competition, and internal efficiency. Yi explicitly mentioned the rigorous compliance measures like KYC, EDD, WCK, and POA that Binance follows. ""It is important to note that many of our competitors do not need to consider KYC, compliance, EDD, WCK, POA as strictly as we do at Binance,"" she stated."	Legal Drama Unfolded
Yi's call for logical reasoning among employees seems to be a response to the multiple regulatory pressures the company is facing, particularly from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
On May 6, 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice's national security division initiated an inquiry into Binance. This inquiry is focused on whether Binance allowed Russian customers to access its platform in violation of U.S. sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
This investigation is not an isolated incident; it adds to a 2021 joint probe by the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service, and an ongoing SEC investigation that filed 13 charges against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, on June 5, 2023.	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan
"Amidst these complexities, Binance recently announced that it would sell its entire Russian operations to CommEX. Noah Perlman, Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer, cited compliance strategy as the reason for this exit. ""As we look toward the future, we recognize that operating in Russia is not compatible with Binance's compliance strategy,"" Perlman mentioned. This strategic move is expected to take up to a year to fully transition existing Russian users to CommEX."	He Yi`s Strategic Compliance Masterplan

Binance Co-founder He Yi Clarifies Token Listing Criteria and Addresses Market Volatility Concerns	Token Hype
Rebeca Moen Jun 04, 2023 18:38	He Yi’s Binance Listing Insights
Binance Co-founder He Yi has recently taken to Twitter to discuss the criteria for token listings on the platform, emphasizing that Binance strives to consider the majority of user demands when listing coins.	Token Hype
Binance Co-founder He Yi has recently taken to Twitter to discuss the criteria for token listings on the platform, emphasizing that Binance strives to consider the majority of user demands when listing coins. He stated that listing decisions aren't solely at the discretion of one person, including CEO Changpeng Zhao, but are a broader collaborative decision-making process.	Token Hype
In his tweets, He Yi also touched on issues related to coin performance and market volatility. He mentioned that some newly listed tokens have not performed well, while some lesser-known tokens have experienced drastic price fluctuations. In response, Binance monitors the wallets of project owners and market makers associated with the Launchpad platform. In addition, they are now requiring multi-party custody of tokens issued by project owners as part of mutual oversight.	Token Hype, Market Frenzy
"Addressing recent Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) that quickly achieved multi-billion-dollar market capitalizations upon listing, He Yi highlighted that ""a large number of projects come from the previous bull market, and are generally over-pursued by capital."" Consequently, the price of IEO projects listed on Binance is typically lower than the price of the last round of investor investments."	IEO Buzz, Transparent Economy
"He Yi also criticized the practice of directly listing projects based on market pricing given by users. He found this approach to valuing market capitalization unreasonable. ""Projects are often priced based on what users are willing to pay in the market, a point we find very unreasonable when it comes to market capitalization,"" he said."	Transparent Economy
These statements and actions underscore Binance's commitment to maintain fairness and transparency in their token listing process and to mitigate the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading.	Transparent Economy

Host: Jenny Yang, founder of Star Finance	Host
Guest: YiYi, co-founder and CMO of Coin Security	Guest
Hello everyone, I am so happy to have this precious opportunity to communicate with yi Jie today! So let’s start our live broadcast today	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Today, I am very happy to talk with my sister about the contract transaction and the success of Coin security. To begin with, please allow me to introduce Yi Jie to you	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
YiYiYi: Ok, thanks, Jenny	Guest
He Yi is cofounder and CMO of Coin Security.	Guest
In 2012, he joined travel TV and served as the host of beautiful Destination, How Far, How Beautiful the World is. In 2014, he became the co-founder of OKCoin and created OKCoin. In the same year, she became the guest of only you, a well-known career program, and popularized bitcoin as the representative of the post-80s female entrepreneurs.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
In 2015, I joined Junior Technology Co., Ltd. as vice President, responsible for technology and its product market.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
In 2016, we built the largest live streaming platform in China. After he Yi joined The technology, The company has completed two rounds of financing, with a market value of more than 20 billion yuan. It has three well-known mobile Internet products, including Miaopai, Xiaokaxiu and Yizhi.	Guest
A sparkling career resume!	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q1.Jenny Yang: Coinstar announced the acquisition of digital currency derivatives trading service Platform JEX in early September. What’s your consideration?	Host
YiYiYi: Actually speaking of the team of JEX, they are also our old colleagues in those days. From the point of view of their personal ability or worthy of affirmation, I think it may just not meet a suitable position. And we started talking about getting them to join coinage a long time ago.	Guest
JEX team is a team of partial products and partial technologies. They will have more innovation possibilities in the direction of financial derivatives, but there will be some deficiencies in the market and operation. Coan hopes to help JEX in terms of brand and market.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
We will still let JEX take the contract and our contract to PK, but in a longer period of time they will put more time and energy to do options and other financial derivatives. In my opinion, it is a false proposition whether a company can only choose one homogeneous product type.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
For example, Tencent’s WeChat QQ, Tencent’s horse racing mechanism, the same company may do two identical products at the same time. Then there are, for example, pantene, Float, Head and Shoulders under p&g Prestige. They may have different brands, but they all sell shampoo. We hope to provide users with more innovative and easy to use products through the internal competition between JEX and coin-safety contracts.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q2. Before the layout of contract track, many exchanges have laid out this field for a long time, such as Bitmex, OKEX, Huobi, Bibox, Matcha and so on. Compared with them, what are the differences and advantages of contract trading in Bitmex? How to differentiate competition?	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
(YiYiYi) : currency Ann’s on-site contracts with other contracts, orders, we compared to the station before the contract and contract more financial rocks, because it is made of the CME group, that many users, especially the big customer, they turned out to be for traditional contract, will be familiar with, they will be very simple and easy-to-use, Ann can also perceive currency financial background and professional team.	Guest
First of all, you’ll notice that our product is a positive contract for USDT margin, which is a much lower barrier to entry for traditional institutional or financial users.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Second: price movements in past contracts were easy to manipulate. So in the process of product design, we take the composite index of multiple platforms, and the ratio of this index is not fully disclosed at present. If you want to manipulate the market, you need to manipulate the spot of these several platforms, in order to achieve the purpose. In this way, the cost is much higher, and correspondingly, the probability of being manipulated by Zhuang Zhuang market is much smaller. Trying to crash the contract market on Coinan or JEX will cause no real harm to users, except for ugly K-lines.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Again, you will find that our platform is not out of stock, it is the use of intelligent closing mechanism, is a mechanism to close a position. That is to say, after you close every hand will go to cheek your margin rate, this system matchmaking has higher requirements. The in-station contract has a Matchmaking engine comparable to Nasdaq, which can meet the requirements of real-time detection data.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Finally, intra-industry contract comparisons are often criticized for sharing. Coin-ahn station contract is the use of automatic reduction mechanism, so the user’s profit will not be apportioned. Then we also set up an insurance fund, which will act as a buffer, so as to reduce the probability of automatic reduction.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
To put it simply, COinstone has always put the interests of users in the first place, and has adopted multiple measures in the design process of the contract to help users reduce risks.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Thanks to the exploration and efforts made by the previous colleagues, of course, we can see that there are some COINS and security contracts in the market, which are generally not on the dot. Maybe the people in their water army do not know what the contract is.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q3. Jenny Yang, moderator: Risk control is the core of contract trading. In this respect, what measures did money security do to protect the safety of user funds?	Host
(YiYiYi) : The contract in Coin-An station should be one of the most stable products among the contract products of the mainstream trading platform at present. Our matching engine can be comparable to the matching engine of Nasdaq. It can handle 100,000 orders per second, and there will be no congestion under extreme conditions.	Guest
For example, under the bitcoin boom these days, the contract products of some platforms are delayed and cannot be opened. It is commonly known in the industry as “unplugging”. The station contract of Money and security is still as always in high speed and smooth, can hold the extreme market trading volume boom, the stability of the system is the cornerstone of all risk control measures.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
In terms of risk control, our closing price is based on the spot price index, rather than the price of a single platform, which reduces the number of positions that explode because a single platform has been manipulated.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Our intelligent closing mechanism, which is to close the position hand by hand, for the user to retain part of the position, there is no concept of a burst. Before there is a small black said in advance of the explosion, the currency and safety station contract itself is not the explosion of this matter, but in the current margin rate to maintain the margin rate, start the operation of intelligent liquidation. Then we will also optimize and adjust this margin rate.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Finally, we set up an insurance fund, which is one of the few in the market that will actually pick up a user’s position, and is another safeguard before the automatic reduction. Since we put the contract online, there has not been an automatic reduction.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
The platform should do what the platform should do in a down-to-earth manner, and only earning the commission fee is a good risk control for users.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q4. Jenny Yang: How does Coan deal with the extreme market? How to minimize the loss when the market is out of control?	Host
YiYiYi: The contract product itself is a tool to cope with extreme market conditions and realize hedging arbitrage. Meanwhile, the contract itself is a relatively high-risk product, just like two sides of a sharp weapon.	Guest
We also stand on the shoulders of predecessors for the product of a lot of structural innovation and adjustment, as much as possible to protect the leek. Now, as I said, in terms of system stability, we have been tested, even in the event of a big market, the system itself is stable; Then, whether it’s spot price indices, smart closing mechanisms, or insurance funds, they all protect users from different dimensions. I can’t say that the COinstar contract will never happen, but I can say that coinstar is a team that accepts its imperfection and keeps on iterating, as well as a team that doesn’t shy away from taking responsibility.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q5.Some people can get rich overnight, but some people can get rich overnight. There have been tragic events before. There is no doubt that contracts are very high-risk investment products.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
(YiYiYi) : Well hedged risk, as I said before; The ones that don’t do well do lose their money; Before, I often received private messages from people about how I lost money because of the contract. First of all, I don’t recommend anyone who lacks self-control to sign a contract; In financial investments, we usually recommend that no more than 30% of assets be invested in high-risk categories, and the same is true for coinage.	Guest
Q6. Jenny Yang: Are there any current incentives for professional investor quantification teams or market makers?	Host
(YiYiYi) : The rate structure of COIN security is exactly the same as that of order booking, so there has been no professional market trader in spot or contract. The recent peer even gave the futures and spot are listed at a discount to maintain the prosperity; Many trading clients have also offered to trade at a discount elsewhere; We don’t even give a discount, so we have a market plan. We are now looking for market makers around the world, and we invite this trading team with an excellent listing strategy to join coon’s global Market Maker program. Interested teams can email mmprogram@binance.com or contact the key account manager directly.	Guest
Joining coan marketmakers can enjoy special processing rates, higher API orders and, of course, exclusive services from key account managers.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
The final benefit of full competition is the user, perhaps the current big customer is more obvious, we also launched his VIP is my VIP +1 activities	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q7.Recently, Coin security announced the concept of “three-body coin security”, and I personally like your slogan “Lead, Not Follow”. One of the three bodies includes the domestic market. So the question is, will coin return to the Chinese market? What are the plans?	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
YiYiYi: The Three-Body Problem is one of my favorite novels. In fact, it is an iterative process of COinstone itself. In the past, Coinstone upgraded from a trading platform to a public chain. But now, coin from a public chain and back to do compliance, to do product support and business line support, in fact, is a dimension reduction attack.	Guest
“Lead, not Follow” is a favorite of CZ. We are doing a company, develops the market, to really succeed, impossible to say by following others, and you have to have more innovation, to lead the development of the industry, such as currency Ann Launchpad, COINS, the community vote on currency, SAFU fund, currency Ann chain, COINS, ecology, these are the currency created innumerable first, we are pleased to see that these innovations not only bring money, influence, also promote the industry constantly iteration.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Currency security is a global strategy from the very beginning. Users come from more than 200 countries and regions. China is also one of the markets that currency Security attaches great importance to. So it can’t be said that the return, to be exact, money has been listening to the hearts of users, but also aware of their imperfections. The previous experience of Chinese users was really forced by the wall in terms of access fluency. At present, the technology and product team are also constantly doing product iteration to optimize the experience in this area. Welcome to experience Binancezh.com, you can feedback to me.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q8.Thanks to my work, I had the honor to participate in a large number of domestic and international high-quality conferences and industry activities. When I communicated with you, I found that you all had a high opinion of COIN security. In your opinion, what factors have made COBE stand out from the global competition of exchanges?	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
YiYiYi: First of all, the timing is important. We were founded at the beginning of the bull market. We happened to trade coinage. In fact, at that time overseas B network and P network has been rising; It also happens to be the time when Crypto erupts;	Guest
Secondly, due to geographical location, IT follows the strategy of globalization. At the beginning, it consists of offices and teams in several countries, which will not be greatly impacted by the policy adjustment of a certain country.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
It is also a blockchain ecosystem that includes trading platforms, Launchpad, Labs, Research institutes, Colleges, Info, Charity, coin Security chain, DEX, Binance X, Trust Wallet.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Finally, we have a hardcore team with the same ideas and values and the same goals. We hope to achieve some awesome things. In order to achieve the goal, some short-term personal interests can be given up, so that the team will only have a small amount of money to subsidize the refund users in the early stage of COIN security. The first person in the trading platform to get the wrong money back to the user; Rather than the BNB party rushing to cash in or get results, we all believe airbnb is just getting off the ground.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Q9.In recent months, exchanges have sprung up again. People even joke that there are more sickles than leeks in the market.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
In such a competitive field, do you have the confidence to maintain the leading position? What are your plans and ideas?	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
YiYiYi: The biggest advantage of COIN security is its professionalism. Although people often joke that coin security cannot be opened, you can ask the users of professional trading institutions that coin security is far more professional in the financial field than its peers.	Guest
The second is the technology, which is not a network optimization technology, but a technology to do the public chain is really to develop the public chain itself. Some time ago, the coin public chain just completed the quantum exchange. Archimedes was upgraded yesterday.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Second, safety. As the old saying goes, a long illness leads to a cure. The security level of coin security is far superior to that of peers. Another point is that some platforms may not have the ability to pay for security incidents. We’d rather put the question on the table.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
The last point is the value, a team is easy to make money to satisfy the status quo, or “cut leek”, in the face of temptation to stand firm is not easy; Coan is a team that has seen money and made money. We have our own insistence, which is not easy, but we will stick to it.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
Also good news: Airbnb and Amun are ready to launch on the Swiss stock exchange.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution
BNB ETP will pave the way for more innovative products to follow and boost the global popularity of cryptographic assets. Airbnb was initially used to pay transaction fees and credit discounts on airbnb platforms, but has since evolved into common chain currency. Currently it is one of the most widely used practical tokens in the blockchain sector with a market value of more than 2.5 billion US dollars, ranking eighth in the world.	He Yi`s Crypto Revolution

The Binance CEO shared a screenshot and a tweet of one such scam evolving around the Binance Labs Incubation program.	Telegram Scam Alerts, Binance Power Moves, Stay Vigilant! Security Tips, Incubator Game-Changers, Social Media Risks Exposed, Leadership Disruptors, Crypto Trends Redefined
Binance incubation is a two-month program with mentoring sessions and fireside chats with industry luminaries and a network of other founders. Applications for the Season 7 program are open until April 15, 2024.	Binance Power Moves, Token Listing Secrets Unlocked, Incubator Game-Changers, Leadership Disruptors, Crypto Trends Redefined
Binance Labs is run by Yi He, who cofounded Binance with former CEO Changpeng (CZ) Zhao. The venture capital business is a frequent early-stage sponsor of cryptocurrency ventures. It also operates both as a venture capital investor and an incubator, with one program focusing on firms building on the BNB Chain and another that is blockchain-agnostic.	Binance Power Moves, Blockchain Revolution, Venture Capital Titans, Leadership Disruptors, Crypto Trends Redefined
According to reports, Binance Labs has become an independent entity and severed some ties with the larger group. Crypto exchange Binance quietly spun off its $10 billion venture capital arm earlier this year, in one of the most notable developments of CEO Richard Teng's early tenure.	Token Listing Secrets Unlocked, Blockchain Revolution, Venture Capital Titans, Leadership Disruptors, Crypto Trends Redefined

Stating that WSJ has consistently targeted Binance, Yi He said, “I would like to thank WSJ for its long-term investment in Binance. Because WSJ has been consistently reporting about us for a long time. “I am grateful to them for saving us their budget. However, while reporting this kind of news, WSJ did not report that Binance was assisting law enforcement and assisting in the arrest of Zkasino's main culprit. This shows that WSJ acted with bias.” said.
