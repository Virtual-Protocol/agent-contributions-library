1	We're living through history
2	We really are
3	Let's begin with your decision
4	You're at your home, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware
5	late July with your family, and you make this historic decision
6	Tell me the story
7	Look, the polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race
8	We would have been down on the wire
9	But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races
10	And I was concerned if I stayed in the race
11	That would be the topic
12	You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did someone, and I thought it would be a real distraction, number one
13	Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president
14	I can't even say how old I am
15	It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth
16	But things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen
17	And the combination was that I thought it was a critical issue for me still, it's not a joke, maintaining this democracy
18	But I thought it was important because although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I, the most important thing to do, and that is we must, we must, we must defeat Trump
19	I saw those images of your family in the Oval Office sitting just over to your left as you addressed the nation
20	They came up to you after the speech
21	It's what they said to me
22	They said, my grandchildren call me Papa
23	My children call me Dad
24	And they said they're proud
25	And it mattered to me a lot
26	When I saw you with your family in the Oval
27	I wondered, is he thinking of Bo, too
28	Look, I can honestly say that I think of him all the time
29	Whenever I have a decision that's really hard to make, I literally ask myself, what will Bo do
30	He should be sitting here being interviewed, not me
31	He was really a fine man
32	You know, Bo
33	Bo was committed to my staying committed
34	We had a conversation toward the end when he was — everybody — we knew he wasn't going to live
35	And he said, Dad, I know
36	We know it's going to happen
37	He said, I'm going to be okay, Dad
38	I'm all right
39	I'm not afraid
40	But, Dad, you got to make me a promise
41	I said, What's that, Bo
42	He said, I know when it happens, you're going to want to quit
43	you're not going to stay engaged
44	Even when my dad used to say, look at me
45	Look at me, dad
46	Give me your word as a Biden
47	When I go, you'll stay engaged
48	Give me your word
49	Give me your word
50	And I did
51	And then that's why I had not planned on running after he died
52	And then Charlottesville happened
53	In 2017, white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly when on August 12th, Heather Heyer, a civil rights activist, was murdered in what the Justice Department called a hate-inspired act of domestic terrorism
54	Biden has long traced his decision to run in 2020 to that moment
55	It really is the beginning of your journey
56	to the presidency
57	As you look at American democracy seven years later, how do you see it
58	When I spoke to the mom who lost her daughter
59	It's a consequence of those neo-Nazis and white supremacists coming out of the fields in America with torches, carrying Nazi banners, singing the same sick, anti-Semitic bile that was sung in Germany in the 30s
60	And when her daughter was killed, the press went to the then-President Trump and said, what do you think
61	He said, they're very fine people on both sides
62	I knew then, I knew I had to do something
63	And that's how I decided to run
64	Because democracy was literally at stake
65	And you know
66	and then he made, he evidenced everything that we thought
67	You know, January 6th went, attack on the Capitol
68	Talked about, now, because he now talks about making sure they're all, you know, let out of prison, they're gonna pardon them
69	Think of this
70	Every other time the Ku Klux Klan's been involved, they wore hoods so they're not identified
71	Under his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally
72	That's how I read it
73	They knew they had an ally in the White House
74	And he stepped up for them
75	Are you confident that there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025
76	If Trump wins, no, I'm not confident at all
77	I mean, if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all
78	He means what he says
79	We don't take him seriously
80	He means it
81	All the stuff about, if we lose, there'll be a bloodbath, it'll have to be a stolen election
82	Look what they're trying to do now in the local election districts where people count the votes
83	They're putting people in place in states that they're going to count the votes, right
84	You can't love your country only when you win
85	Trump has said his remarks on Charlottesville were not intended to praise white nationalists and that he was warning of economic carnage when he said bloodbath
86	But Trump isn't the only thing on Biden's mind
87	You have about five months left in your presidency
88	You're managing two wars, domestic policy, the economy, on foreign policy
89	Israel's war with Hamas, is a ceasefire possible before the end of your term
90	Yes, it's still possible
91	The plan I put together, endorsed by the G7, endorsed by the UN Security Council, et cetera, is still viable
92	And I'm working literally every single day to, and my whole team, to see to it that it doesn't escalate into a regional war
93	But it easily can
94	You've had a lot of ambition
95	Some senators told me in March of 2021, you took them into the Oval Office and pointed up at FDR's portrait and said, we're going big
96	We're going in that direction
97	And we have, with the great help of so many people
98	Look, democracy works
99	And it was very important to prove that it worked
100	I mean, look at what we've been able to do
101	We've created 16 million jobs
102	I mean, real new jobs
103	We've gotten around the brink of having the private sector invest over a trillion dollars, a trillion dollars in the American economy
104	One of the things I fought for as a senator for a long time was to change the dynamic of how we grow the economy, not from the top down, but from the bottom up
105	The idea of trickle-down economics doesn't work, in my view
106	You're proud of this record
107	Will we see you out on the campaign trail for Vice President Harris
108	Yes, you will
109	I talk to her frequently
110	And by the way, I've known her running mate
111	He's a great guy
112	As we say, if we grew up in the same neighborhood, we'd have been friends
113	He's my kind of guy
114	I've known him for several decades
115	I think it's a hell of a team
116	To those who have expressed skepticism about how much you'll be on the trail or about the rest of your term, raised questions about your health, what do you say to them
117	All I can say is watch, that's all
118	Look, I had a really, really bad day in that debate because I was sick
119	But I have no serious problem
120	I was talking to Governor Shapiro, who's a friend
121	We have to win Pennsylvania, my original home state
122	He and I are putting together a campaign tour in Pennsylvania
123	I'm going to be campaigning in other states as well
124	And I'm going to do whatever in common things I can do to help most
125	We had this conversation in the president's private residence, here in the White House Treaty Room, where historic peace agreements have been signed
126	Watching over us, Ulysses S. Grant, the general-turned-president who labored to restore the Union after the Civil War
127	When you think about the presidency, we're here in a special room in the residence, so much history in this room
128	How do you want history to remember President Biden
129	that he proved democracy can work
130	It got us out of a pandemic
131	It produced the single greatest economic recovery in American history
132	We're the most powerful economy in the world
133	We have more to do
134	And it demonstrated that we can pull the nation together
135	Look, I've always believed, and I still do, the American people are good and decent, honorable people
136	When I announced my candidacy to run way back for president, I said, we've got to do three things
137	Restore the soul of America, build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, and bring the country together
138	No one thought we could get done, and including some of my own people, what we got done
139	But one of the problems is I knew all the things we did were going to take a little time to work your way through
140	So now people are realizing, oh
141	That highway, oh, that big mistake we made, we didn't put up signs saying Joe did it
142	Folks, the people of this nation have spoken
143	Four years ago, what Joe did was defeat Donald Trump
144	Now, with Trump attempting to return to the White House, Biden is sounding the alarm, in a way sitting presidents rarely, if ever, do
145	The stakes are that high to you
146	I give you my word
147	I think that I mark my words
148	If he wins this nomination, I mean, excuse me, this election, watch what happens
149	It's a danger
150	He's a genuine danger to American security
151	Look, we're at an inflection point in world history
152	We really are
153	The decisions we make in the last three, four years and the next three, four years are going to determine what the next six decades look like
154	And democracy is the key
155	And that's why I went down and made that speech at Johnson Center about the Supreme Court
156	The Supreme Court is so out of whack
157	So out of whack
158	And so, I propose that we limit the terms to 18 years
159	So, anyway, there's little regard by the MAGA Republicans for the political institutions
160	That's what holds this country together
161	That's what democracy is about
162	That's who we are as a nation
163	Mr. President, thank you
164	I appreciate it
165	It's an honor to be with you
166	An honor to be in this room with you
