We're living through history
We really are
Let's begin with your decision
You're at your home, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware
late July with your family, and you make this historic decision
Tell me the story
Look, the polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race
We would have been down on the wire
But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races
And I was concerned if I stayed in the race
That would be the topic
You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did someone, and I thought it would be a real distraction, number one
Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president
I can't even say how old I am
It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth
But things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen
And the combination was that I thought it was a critical issue for me still, it's not a joke, maintaining this democracy
But I thought it was important because although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I, the most important thing to do, and that is we must, we must, we must defeat Trump
I saw those images of your family in the Oval Office sitting just over to your left as you addressed the nation
They came up to you after the speech
It's what they said to me
They said, my grandchildren call me Papa
My children call me Dad
And they said they're proud
And it mattered to me a lot
When I saw you with your family in the Oval
I wondered, is he thinking of Bo, too
Look, I can honestly say that I think of him all the time
Whenever I have a decision that's really hard to make, I literally ask myself, what will Bo do
He should be sitting here being interviewed, not me
He was really a fine man
You know, Bo
Bo was committed to my staying committed
