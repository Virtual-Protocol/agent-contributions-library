1. I'm all ears.
2. Born in a prison?
3. Bane was a member of the League of Shadows?
4. I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.
5. If this man is everything that you say he is, then the city needs me.
6. You're afraid that if I go back out there, I'll fail.
7. What if he doesn't exist anymore?
8. You sound like you're looking forward to it.
9. Must've lost my ticket.
10. Alfred, Rachel died knowing that we had decided to be together. That was my life beyond the cave. I can't just move on. She didn't. She couldn't.
11. She didn't, I can't change that.
12. How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?
13. You're sorry? You expect to destroy my world, and then think we're going to shake hands?
14. What does it mean?
15. Goodbye, Alfred.
16. You made a serious mistake.
17. Why didn't you just kill me?
18. Actually, there were seven of them.
19. How do you know my name?
20. Who are you?
21. What makes you think I need a path?
22. And what path can Ra’s Al Ghul offer?
23. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
24. The man had a gun!
25. I've had training!
26. You didn't know my father.
27. What stopped it?
28. That's no help to me.
29. It's my father's house.
30. This place is a mausoleum. If I had my way, I'd pull the damn thing down, brick by brick.
31. Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family.
32. You still haven't given up on me?
33. Maybe I should be thanking him.
34. What if I do? My parents deserve justice.
35. Sometimes, they're the same thing.
36. Your system is broken.
37. I'm not one of your 'good people', Rachel.
38. All these years, I wanted to kill him. Now I can't.
39. I didn't come here to thank you. I came here to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.
40. I'm not afraid of you.
41. Don't turn around. You're a good cop, one of the few.
42. Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week. Nobody takes him down. Why?
43. What would it take to bring him down?
44. Taste of your own medicine, doctor? What have you been doing here? What was your plan? Crane! Who are you working for?
45. Ra's al Ghul is dead! Who are you working for? Crane!
46. So Crane was working for you.
47. I wanted to save Gotham. I've failed.
48. Who said anything aboutstoppingit?! You never learned to mind your surroundings!
49. I won't kill you...but I don't have to save you.
50. And I bought most of the shares - through various charitable foundations, and trusts, and so forth. Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing is thatmy company's future is secure. Right, Mr. Fox?
51. And you'll never have to.
52. The house treats luck like an insult.
53. But all accounts are balanced in the end. Three nights with aBolshoiballerina and that line was all she taught me.
54. Oh, my foundation has already issued a statement in support of– books.
55. Wow! Pretty girl – bad habit. Don't quote me, alright?
56. Daily Planet– Wait, do I own this one? Or was that the other guy?
57. Don't believe everything you hear, son.
58. Maybe it's that Gotham City in me. We just have a bad history withfreaks dressed like clowns.
59. It's a fake. The real one was sold in'98on the black market. And now it hangs...
60. Excuse me, miss. The other night you took something that doesn't belong to you. Stealing's not polite.
61. You know, I bet with that dress, nine out of ten men will let you get away with anything.
62. Hmm, I'm guessing I'm the first to see through that babe-in-the-woods act. You don't know me, but I've known a few women like you.
63. It's a weapon. It's a rock. A mineral capable of weakening Kryptonian cells. The first sample big enough to mean something turned up inthe Indian Oceanthree months ago. It is now aboard the White Portuguese being delivered to Lex Luthor. Who I am going to steal it from.
64. That son of a bitch brought war to us two years ago. Jesus, Alfred, count the dead. Thousands of people. What's next? Millions? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race, and if we believe there's a 1% chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty. And we have to destroy him.
65. Not today. Twenty years in Gotham, Alfred. we've seen what promises are worth. How many good guys are left. How many stayed that way. Fourteen hours.
66. I'm older now than my father ever was. This may be the only thing I do that matters.
67. The first generation made their fortune trading with the French. Pelts and skins. They were hunters.
68. Well, here I am.
69. I understand.
70. Breathe it in. That's fear. You're not brave. Men are brave. I bet your parents taught you that you mean something. That you're here for a reason. My parents taught me a different lesson, dying in the gutter for no reason at all. They taught me the world only makes sense if you force it to. You were never a god. You were never even a man.
71. What does that mean? Why did you say that name?
72. I believe you.
73. It's okay. I'm a friend of your son.
74. I'd rather do the breaking in person.
75. The port is abandoned. There's a weapon here that can kill it.
76. I've been a little busy.
77. I thought she was with you.
78. All the circuses back east – burying an empty box.
79. They will. And they'll fight. We have to stand together.
80. Men are still good. We fight. We kill. We betray one another. But we can rebuild. We can do better. We will. We have to.
81. Just a feeling.
82. Whatever you do, wherever you go,I'll be watching you!
83. That's right. We have hospitals that treat the mentally ill with compassion. But that's not where you're going. I arranged for you to get a transfer to Arkham Asylum in Gotham. I still have some friends there.They're expecting you.
84. There is a stranger who comes to this village from the sea. He comes in the winter when people are hungry, he brings fish, comes on the king tide. That was last night.
85. Yeah, I think I met one. We didn't hit it Off.
86. They're all over. They're looking for his… boxes?
87. Mother Boxes. I guess Steppenwolf took the one your people were guarding. That leaves two more.
88. Don't be. I have no idea what's in them. A weapon? Some kind of power?
89. Something tells me we're not getting the band back together.
90. Well, I wouldn't count on the tribes of men. We tend to act like the Doomsday Clock has a snooze button. How long until--
91. Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.
92. Tell me about this.
93. Silica-based quartz sand fabric. Abrasion resistant. Heat resistant.
94. It's what they use on the space shuttle to prevent it from burning up on re-entry.
95. So, you're fast.
96. I'm putting together a team. People with special abilities. You see, I believe enemies are coming.
97. You are?
98. I'll try to keep up.
99. Three, including you.
100. I'll tell you on the plane.
101. I'm rich.
102. Not enough.
103. Save one person.
104. Don't talk, don't fight. Get in, get one out.
105. You'll know.
106. Gotham Harbor.
107. May be temporary.
108. And that's what science is for: to do what's never been done. To make life better.
109. I'm not the one who brought a pitchfork.
110. We buy him some time, he can stop that box from destroying all life on Earth– we hope.
111. Yeah,Nowshe's glad.
112. I just undid a mistake, that's all.
113. I bought the bank.
114. It's like a reflex with me, I don't know.
115. You look tired, Alfred. You'll be all right without me?
116. Then you're gonna love me.
117. Targeting me won't get their money back. I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight, but this is different. They've crossed a line.
118. Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just need to figure out what he's after.
119. So why steal them?
120. People are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?
121. Well, today I found out what Batman can't do. He can't endure this. Today you get to say I told you so.
122. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea!
123. I want the Joker.
124. I'm counting on it. WHERE IS HE?!
125. He must have friends!
126. Someone knows where he is!
127. You'd leave a man's life to chance?
128. His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a paranoid schizophrenic. Former patient at Arkham - the kind of mind the Joker attracts. What do you expect to learn from him?
129. You're the symbol of hope I could never be. Your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades. If anyone saw this, everything would be undone. All the criminals you pulled off the streets would be released, and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing. You're going to hold a press conference, tomorrow morning.
130. No one else will die because of me. Gotham's in your hands now.
131. Where's Dent?
132. I'm considering it.
133. WHERE ARE THEY?!
134. That bandit, in the forest in Burma...did you catch him?
135. There won't be any fireworks!
136. What were you trying to prove? That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you? You're alone!
137. No, but I know how you got these!
138. You'll be in a padded cell forever!
139. This city just showed you that it's full of people ready to believe in good.
140. What did you do?
141. You don't want to hurt the boy, Harvey.
142. What happened to Rachel wasn't chance. We decided to act — we three.
143. Because you were the best of us! He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you could fall.
144. They won't. They must never know what he did.
145. But the Joker cannot win. Gotham needs its true hero.
146. I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be. Call it in.
147. You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me, set the dogs on me, because that's what needs to happen, because sometimes truth isn't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
