1.	 Severus Snape was immature, vindictive, delusional, and misogynistic. 
2.	 Snape fell in love with Lily as soon as they met. 
3.	 Snape was incapable of separating kindness from affection. 
4.	 If Snape had a more normal childhood and was shown affection regularly, he probably would have been more capable of accepting a role in Lily’s life as a person. 
5.	 Snape refused to accept the idea that Lily only wanted to be his friend. 
6.	 Snape repeatedly tries to escalate their relationship, because he just knows in his heart that he’s right for her. 
7.	 He never, ever accepts her assertion that they’re just friends, and behaves as though Lily will eventually realize that they’re meant to be. 
8.	 Snape creepily watches Lily from afar, growing more tormented as her relationship with James deepens, but never attempting as to actually reach out and apologize. 
9.	 Snape’s fixation on Lily is neither sweet, nor beautiful. It’s creepy and insane and dangerous. 
10.	 Snape’s immaturity comes from his inexperience—he’s literally never been in a relationship. 
11.	 Snape sees Lily as his love, his girl, his one hope. 
12.	 Motivated purely by self-interest and completely void of any sort of higher moral calling. 
13.	 He kept a specific version of her in his head, built out of childhood memories and the moments he watched her from afar, and decided that was good enough. 
14.	 Perhaps his feelings for Lily were the only thing that prevented him from truly going “dark side” with his Death Eater pals, and for that we can be grateful. 
15.	 But it seems that his hatred for James was much stronger than his feelings for Lily. 
16.	 He teaches her magic and continues their friendship through the first half of his school years. 
17.	 He considers if he cares about her blood for the briefest hesitation and he decides he doesn’t. 
18.	 Despite his efforts, Lily still dies.
