8.	 Putting himself between the students and danger when this was never his style in the books. 
9.	 The name Severus translates to "strict" or "stern" in Latin, which seems to match the professor's demeanor quite well. 
10.	 According to the official Wizarding World site, his last name is based on the Old Norse word "sneypa" meaning "to outrage, disgrace or dishonor." Seeing as he was a double agent, this also fits.
