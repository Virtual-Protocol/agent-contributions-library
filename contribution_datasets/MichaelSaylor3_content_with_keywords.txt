This metric offers a more in-depth view of the performance of the investment in bitcoin compared to the market value, showing how the company’s acquisition strategies translate into benefits for the shareholders. The increase in the price of bitcoin in recent months has clearly contributed to the improvement of these performances, making MicroStrategy one of the major beneficiaries of the recent growth of the criptovalute	Bitcoin, MicroStrategy
market. A long-term vision As mentioned, MicroStrategy started buying bitcoin in 2020, when Michael Saylor decided to redirect the company’s strategy towards what he considers “digital gold”	Bitcoin, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy, digital gold
Since then, the company has consistently expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio, making several massive purchases during market downturns. The philosophy of Saylor is based on the belief that Bitcoin represents a long-term store of value, comparable to gold, and that it is a fundamental tool for protecting capital against inflation and the devaluation of traditional currencies	inflation, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency
MicroStrategy has redefined its corporate purpose, transitioning from a traditional enterprise software company to a “bitcoin development company”. This transformation has been closely followed by the markets and financial analysts, with many seeing MicroStrategy as a pioneer in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies	institutional adoption, Bitcoin, MicroStrategy
The data from BitcoinTreasuries , a platform that monitors the bitcoin holdings of public companies, clearly shows that MicroStrategy is the largest holder of bitcoin among all publicly traded companies. Market implications after Michael Saylor’s latest MicroStrategy purchase in Bitcoin The increase in MicroStrategy’s holdings in Bitcoin is not just a corporate move, but also has broader implications for the cryptocurrency market	MicroStrategy, BitcoinTreasuries, Michael Saylor, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency
The purchase of large quantities of Bitcoin by a publicly traded company further helps to legitimize the adoption of cryptocurrencies at the institutional level. While other large companies have started to explore the opportunity to integrate bitcoin into their balance sheets, MicroStrategy remains one of the few to have adopted such a decisive and large-scale strategy	Bitcoin, MicroStrategy
However, this move also involves risks. The high volatility of the cryptocurrency market could severely test MicroStrategy’s investments in the event of a reversal in the price of bitcoin	volatility, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy
Despite this, Michael Saylor has repeatedly stated that he is confident in the resilience of bitcoin in the long term, remaining steadfast in his belief that the cryptocurrency will continue to grow and play a central role in the global financial system.
