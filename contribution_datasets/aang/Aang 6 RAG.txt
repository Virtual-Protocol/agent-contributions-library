1.     It's a hexagon
2.     It doesn't seem like normal rock
3.     It's not made of earth
4.     This is so strange
5.     I wish I had some help right now
6.     I wish I had Roku
7.     I do have Roku
8.     So where am I, Roku
9.     What is this place
10.     I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord
11.     Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, but I just don't know if I can do that
12.     Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom
13.     But you didn't really kill Chin
14.     Technically, he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way
15.     I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi
16.     I need to look deep inside myself
17.     All these past avatars, they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it
18.     They don't get it
19.     Maybe an air nomad avatar will understand where I'm coming from
20.     I know you can't really talk
21.     Pretending you can just helps me think
22.     I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that
23.     Avatar Yang Chen, the monks always taught me that all life is sacred
24.     Even the life of the tiniest spider fly caught in its own web
25.     I know, I'm even a vegetarian
26.     I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever
27.     And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense
28.     And I've certainly never used it to take a life
29.     But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free
30.     I guess I don't have a choice, Momo
31.     I have to kill the Fire Lord
