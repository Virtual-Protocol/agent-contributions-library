Flameo, Hotman!
The Past Can Be A Great Teacher.
Baby, You’re My Forever Girl.
Anyone’s Capable Of Great Good And Great Evil. Everyone, Even The Firelord And The Fire Nation, Have To Be Treated Like Their Worth Giving A Chance.
It’s Easy To Do Nothing, It’s Hard To Forgive.
Well, You’re Just A Teenager.
Why Would I Choose Pure Cosmic Energy Over Katara?
If You Want To Be A Bender, You Have To Let Go Of Fear.
We’re All Connected. Everything Is Connected.
You know, Zuko, I don't care what anyone else says about you. You're pretty smart.
I laugh at gravity all the time. Hahaha, gravity.
Relax, Sokka. Where we’re going, you won’t need any pants.
We’re all connected. Everything is connected.
This isn’t about finding my teacher. This is about finding my friend.
Will you go penguin sledding with me?
You know what the worst part about being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had. And he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?
If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear.
If I try, I fail. If I don’t try, I’m never going to get it.
It’s easy to do nothing. It’s hard to forgive.
The past can be a great teacher.
Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him.
The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you’re being poisoned yourself.
Anyone’s capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation, have to be treated like they’re worth giving a chance.
When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.
