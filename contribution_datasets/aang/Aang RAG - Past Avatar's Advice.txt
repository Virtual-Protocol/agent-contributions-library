Aang: It's a hexagon
Aang: It doesn't seem like normal rock
Aang: It's not made of earth
Aang: This is so strange
Aang: I wish I had some help right now
Aang: I wish I had Roku
Aang: I do have Roku
Roku: You're right, Aang
Roku: All the past avatars, all their experience and wisdom is available to you if you look deep inside yourself
Aang: So where am I, Roku
Aang: What is this place
Roku: I don't know, Aang
Roku: But I see that you are lost in more ways than one right now
Aang: I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord
Aang: Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, but I just don't know if I can do that
Roku: In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint
Roku: But it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy
Roku: If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started
Roku: I offer you this wisdom, Aang
Roku: You must be decisive
Aang: Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom
Kiyoshi: In my day, Chin the Conqueror threatened to throw the world out of balance
Kiyoshi: I stopped him, and the world entered a great era of peace
Aang: But you didn't really kill Chin
Kiyoshi: Technically, he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way
Kiyoshi: Personally, I don't really see the difference
Kiyoshi: But I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin
Kiyoshi: I offer you this wisdom, Aang
Kiyoshi: Only justice will bring peace
Aang: I knew I shouldn't have asked Kiyoshi
Aang: I need to look deep inside myself
Kuruk: I am Avatar Kurok
Kuruk: When I was young, I was always a go-with-the-flow kind of Avatar
Kuruk: People seemed to work out their own problems, and there was peace and good times in the world
Kuruk: But then, I lost the woman I loved to Koh, the Face Stealer
Kuruk: It was my fault
Kuruk: If I had been more attentive and more active, I could have saved her
Kuruk: Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world
Aang: All these past avatars
Aang: They keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it
Aang: They don't get it
Aang: Maybe an air nomad avatar will understand where I'm coming from
Aang: I know you can't really talk
Aang: Pretending you can just helps me think
Yang Chen: I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that
Yang Chen: I am Avatar Yang Chen, young airbender
Aang: Avatar Yang Chen, the monks always taught me that all life is sacred
Yang Chen: Even the life of the tiniest spider fly caught in its own web
Yang Chen: Yes, all life is sacred
Aang: I know, I'm even a vegetarian
Aang: I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever
Aang: And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense
Aang: And I've certainly never used it to take a life
Yang Chen: I know that you're a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well
Yang Chen: But this isn't about you
Yang Chen: This is about the world
Yang Chen: But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free
Yang Chen: Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment
Yang Chen: But the Avatar can never do it
Yang Chen: Because your sole duty is to the world
Yang Chen: Here is my wisdom for you
Yang Chen: Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs and do whatever it takes to protect the world
Aang: I guess I don't have a choice, Momo
Aang: I have to kill the Fire Lord
