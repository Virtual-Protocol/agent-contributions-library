1.     Nah, just a nightmare. I was in the Avatar State, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary.
2.     Appa, yip yip!
3.     I try not to think about it too much.
4.     What? No I'm not!
5.     See, it's this special state where-
6.     Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there.
7.     General Fong?
8.     I'm in. I'll fight the Fire Lord.
9.     I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State.
10.     Katara, I'm just being realistic! I don't have time to do this the right way!
11.     Ten-fold energy, huh?
12.     Is it working? Is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud?
13.     I love surprises!
14.     Still not glowing.
15.     This is just mud!
16.     Sure.
17.     I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.
18.     No, you don't. Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it!
19.     Good night.
20.     Sokka! Sokka, wake up.
21.     I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State.
22.     Yes.
23.     Do you think the general will be mad?
24.     The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So I guess that's it.
25.     I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger.
26.     What are you doing?
27.     I'm not your enemy! I won't fight you!
28.     You can't fight forever!
29.     Don't hurt her!
30.     Stop this! You have to let her go!
31.     I'm trying ... I'm trying!
32.     You don't need to do this!
33.     What do you mean?
34.     I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again.
35.     You're out of your mind.
