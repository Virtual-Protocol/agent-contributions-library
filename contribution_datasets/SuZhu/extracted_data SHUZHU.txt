"Su Zhu (born April 1987)[1] is a Singaporean entrepreneur. Alongside his longtime friend and business partner Kyle Davies, he is a founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital[2] and a founder of Open Exchange (OPNX), a cryptocurrency exchange.[3]
 Zhu was born in China and moved to the United States at the age of 6.[1] He attended high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, graduating in 2006,[4] and graduated summa cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.[5]
 Zhu moved to Tokyo to trade derivatives at Credit Suisse before working as a trader at Flow Traders, a trading shop in Singapore, in 2009. In 2011, he briefly worked as a trader at Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong.
 In 2012 Zhu and Davies founded Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in San Francisco. The two raised approximately $1?ÿmillion in seed capital by borrowing money from their parents.[5] According to Davies in an interview on the podcast UpOnly, 3AC had doubled their money within the first two months.[5]
 In 2013 Zhu and Davies re-registered the hedge fund in Singapore to avoid capital gains tax.[5]
 According to New York Magazine, in its early stage, the hedge fund focused on ""arbitraging emerging-market foreign-exchange derivatives.""[5] This continued until banks cut off 3AC from that market in 2017, which initiated the fund's shift to cryptocurrencies.[5]
 At its peak in March 2022, 3AC managed an estimated $10?ÿbillion in cryptocurrency assets.[6]
 As a result of popularity among cryptocurrency-related topics, Zhu amassed over 500,000 followers on Twitter (now X) shortly before the fund failed.[4]
 On June 16, 2022 The Financial Times reported that 3AC had failed to meet its margin calls.[7] Six days later, The Wall Street Journal reported that the 3AC had failed to repay a $665?ÿmillion Bitcoin and USD Coin loan to Voyager Digital, another cryptocurrency hedge fund.[8][9] The same day, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the liquidation of 3AC, overseen by Teneo.[10]
 On July 2, 2022, 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy to protect its US assets from creditors.[11] The Monetary Authority of Singapore banned Zhu and Davies from participation in the financial sector for nine years.[12]
 In an interview with Bloomberg held at an ""undisclosed location"" in July 2022, Zhu and Davies stated that they plan to move to the United Arab Emirates,[13] a country that does not have extradition treaties with either Singapore or the United States.[14][better?ÿsource?ÿneeded]
 In June 2023 3AC liquidators said they were seeking to recover $1.3?ÿbillion from Davies and Zhu.[15]
 According to The New York Times, during the liquidation process, Zhu and Davies were in Bali, where Zhu attempted surfing and Davies dabbled in painting.[4] Zhu and his family had relocated to Singapore, where they lived in a ""good-class bungalow"" with a ""permaculture farm ƒ?? an elaborate system of lakes and gardens meant to replicate self-sustaining ecosystems in nature. Itƒ??s home to ducks, chickens and numerous types of dragonflies.""[1]
 In late 2022 Zhu and Davies started a second venture called Open Exchange (OPNX) based in Hong Kong, which began offering its own cryptocurrency in 2023.[16]
 In late September 2023 Zhu was arrested at Changi Airport in Singapore,[17] while trying to leave the country.[18] Zhu was arrested pursuant to committal orders which sentenced him to four months in prison for failing to cooperate with the liquidators.[4] Zhu was ultimately imprisoned for three months, and claimed it was a ""really enjoyable experience overall"" in a video published on X.[19]
