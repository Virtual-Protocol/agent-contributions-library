enough for buteran and his crew to jumpstart the cryptocurrency by founding		cryptocurrency
the ethereum foundation an organization that guided and planned out ethereum's		ethereum
development numerous versions were tested changed and refined by July 2015		
a stable version of ethereum arrives to the public under the name of Frontier a		ethereum
more user-friendly iteration launched in March 2016 which propelled the project

the second largest cryptocurrency in the entire blockchain industry and it hosted		blockchain, cryptocurrency
nearly all of the sector's decentralized applications		decentralized
even today ethereum holds strongly onto its position and many believe that it is		ethereum
impossible for any other smart contract ecosystem to replace buteran's creation		
but as with any other project ethereum also had its bad moments during the last		ethereum
Bull Run and some were dangerous enough to shake the Project's foundations the		
first dramatic event that occurred was the launch of the Dow a decentralized		decentralized
autonomous organization that brought a new e-governance system on the		
blockchain during its Ico the Dow collected 150 million dollars for more		blockchain
than 11 000 investors in a historical crowdfunding round but the trouble began		
the moment the project launched a hacker discovered an exploit in the Dow's open		
source code which allowed him to create a copy of the project and steal its		
funds stealing around 50 million dollars the security issue was dramatic enough		
for ethereum to fall from twenty dollars to thirteen dollars in a single day		ethereum
decentralization prevents entered the Dao's developers from making any Swift		dao
decisions so ethereum resorted to going nuclear		ethereum
the entire network hard forked migrating to a version of ethereum before the hack		ethereum
occurred the event raised concerns about ethereum's own decentralization which		ethereum
resulted in the creation of ethereum classic although a majority of users and		ethereum
miners decided to join the new blockchain some have decided to stay		blockchain
with the old one blockchain industry was shaken to the core one more time on June		blockchain

resulting in a newly found interest for all things decentralized vitalik may not		decentralized
be Satoshi but he doesn't need to be with his expertise bright mind and		
philosophical outlook on decentralized governance buteran had enough of an		decentralized
impact on the blockchain industry to at least come near to nakamoto's own		blockchain
Ingenuity the arrival of ethereum 2.0 buteran has the chance to shake the		ethereum
