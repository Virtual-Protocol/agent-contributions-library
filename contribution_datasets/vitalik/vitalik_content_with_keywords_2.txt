September 2024 3 Mins Read Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin claims that he has never sold his ETH holdings since 2018, following rumours about transaction activities. However, reports hint that Buterin recently transferred $10 million worth of ETH to an exchange	ethereum
Ethereum’s (ETH) Vitalik Buterin has responded to widely speculated rumours that suggest that he has sold a substantial amount of his ETH holdings. He said he has not sold ETH for the past six years unless it was channelled into a project within the ecosystem or charity	ethereum
I haven’t sold and kept the proceeds since 2018. All sales have been to support various projects that I think are valuable, either within the Ethereum ecosystem or broader charity (eg	ethereum
biomedical research and development). Prior to his liquidation response, multiple sources disclosed that the Ethereum co-founder had transferred $10 million worth of ETH to an exchange	ethereum
According to Arkham Intelligence, 422,000 ETH ($1.04 billion) had been moved from a wallet address linked to Buterin between 2015 and September 1, 2024. 840,000 ETH has been moved out of the address in the past two years	wallet
On August 30, An X user also posted that Buterin dumped $2 million worth of ETH after making a bullish tweet. Confirming this, Lookonchain disclosed that 3000 ETH was sent to the same address on August 9	
Periodic ETH Movements by Ethereum Foundation The timing appears quite interesting as ETH currently trades around 180% above its 2022 low of $885. Most intriguingly, Buterin’s transfer coincides with that of the Ethereum Foundation	ethereum
In August, the foundation transferred 84,000 ETH ($207 million) to a crypto exchange. Contrary to the wide speculations, the Foundation’s transfers are reported to fall in line with its periodic liquidations to fund development, research, and important projects within the ecosystem	crypto
While this could be for a good course, experts believe that such voluminous liquidations trigger short-term selling pressure. In 2021, the Foundation transferred 20,000 ETH to the Kraken exchange	
Shortly after, the market embarked on an 85% correction. Confirming our recent report , ETH whales are currently reacting with massive selloffs	
Buterin’s Remark on DeFi Recently, Buterin pointed out that $8.4 million in grants were awarded to ecosystem projects last quarter. On top of that, he named betting platform Polymarket and stablecoins USDC and RAI as part of the projects he believes in	defi
On the other side, Buterin expressed his displeasure with business models that incorporate liquidity farming. According to him, they mostly appear unsustainable with time	
Things that I don’t respect are things whose attractiveness comes from some temporary source that has no sustainability, eg. I felt no excitement toward the 2021-era liquidity farming craze because it was obvious that it came from token issuances that are fundamentally temporary	token
Reacting to his recent defence of Ethereum against the claim that the blockchain does not consider Decentralized Finance important, the inventor behind the concept of yield farming, Kain Warwick, mentioned that Buterin is not a Maxi. One of the most critical things that he’s gotten wrong over the last five years is the importance of DeFi	blockchain, ethereum, decentralized, defi

Vitalik Buterin reveals five ways he’d rebuild Ethereum from scratch – DL News Search results All News DeFi More Search results This article is more than three months old DeFi People & culture Vitalik Buterin reveals five ways he’d rebuild Ethereum from scratch DeFi People & culture Vitalik Buterin told developers at an Ethereum conference in Berlin that he has some technical regrets about Ethereum.

Buterin says Ethereum developers should have shipped Proof of Stake sooner. Ethereum is going mainstream with advent of ETFs	ethereum
When 620 weary developers emerged after three days of nonstop coding at this year’s ETHBerlin event last week, few expected Vitalik Buterin to be speaking on stage. The co-founder and prime architect of Ethereum was a surprise guest	ethereum
What was even more surprising were some of his reflections on building the industry’s second-largest blockchain. Buterin described some of the regrets he had about the initial design of Ethereum in detail	blockchain, ethereum
For many in the audience, his discourse not only evoked the halcyon days of the network’s birth in 2014, but it also helped fill in the road map for what comes next for a cryptocurrency now worth $448 billion. The US has just approved a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has launched its own tokenised fund on the blockchain	blockchain, ethereum, cryptocurrency
The Ethereum network has spawned a sprawling ecosystem of developers and financial applications worth more than $63 billion , and it has become a byword for decentralised finance. List of things Still, Buterin, a 30-year-old Canadian-Russian programmer, said he has a list of things he would have done differently	ethereum
They range from the development of Ethereum’s Virtual Machine to smart contracts to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. And he remarked that even as Ethereum goes more mainstream, it’s still misunderstood	ethereum

Then Schoedon popped the question. “With everything you know and everything you learned over the last 10 years, how would you build Ethereum differently today if you could start from scratch?” Schoeden asked	ethereum

Too many bits, too early Buterin’s first qualm concerns Ethereum’s Virtual Machine, which is key to making the network function as a kind of decentralised mega crypto computer. He explained that Ethereum’s original EVM design used 256-bit processing instead of 64- or 32-bit	ethereum, crypto
In computer architecture, the size of computing is measured in bits, with larger bits offering better efficiencies and processing more data. But 256 bits is very inefficient for most operations, and can create a lot of bloat on a blockchain, even for simple tasks	blockchain
For a network in its early days, Ethereum didn’t need to optimise for this. “The original design was way too overfitted for 256-bit,” Buterin told the audience	ethereum
Optimise smart contracts Second, Buterin said the early Ethereum developers should have focused on making it easier to write smart contracts with fewer lines of code. The reason? Added transparency	ethereum
With fewer lines of code, he said, “people can properly see and check what’s going on inside of them.” Volunteers and developers playing music at a hackathon in Berlin. Photocredit: ETHBerlin	
Switch to a ‘crappier’ version of staking Instead of custom-built computers — called miners — running nonstop to secure a blockchain network, Ethereum switched to a different model. Ethereum’s switch from a Proof of Work consensus mechanism — the way nodes in a blockchain like Bitcoin’s agree on the state of transaction data — to Proof of Stake in 2022 should have happened much earlier, Buterin said	blockchain, ethereum, bitcoin, staking
“When we switched to Proof of Stake, we should have been willing to switch to a somewhat crappier version of Proof of Stake earlier on,” he said. “We ended up wasting a lot of cycles on really trying to make Proof of Stake perfect.” Instead of miners, Ethereum is now secured by validators who have staked 32 Ethereum, worth roughly $124,000 , to do the same thing — and be rewarded for it	ethereum
If they misbehave by validating fraudulent transactions, for example, they are penalised. In sum, the switch swapped out raw, energy-intensive computing power with economic incentives	
“We could have saved a huge amount of trees if we had a much simpler proof-of-stake in 2018,” Buterin said. Issue logs from day one From big-money token transfers to backdoor honey pots, users can follow the money quite easily in crypto	token, crypto
That’s thanks in part to automatic logging. But as the industry advances, notably moving from externally owned accounts like MetaMask to smart wallets like Safe, certain aspects of that crucial logging are lost	
Notably, automatic logs for Ether transfers. “It should have been in there from the beginning,” Buterin said	
“It could have been like 30 minutes of coding from myself, Gav and Jeff. Instead, it’s an EIP.” Ethereum Improvement Proposals are formal proposals made by developers to change certain aspects of the Ethereum network	ethereum

Photocredit: Liam Kelly/DL News. Drop Keccak Buterin also said he would have used SHA-2 for Ethereum’s hash function rather than the current function called Keccak	ethereum
To understand the difference, one must dig into a bit of cryptography lore, specifically about how SHA-3 became a standard. Remember, before crypto became synonymous with celebrity memecoins and nine-figure initial coin offerings, it was about complicated math	crypto
When Ethereum was being built, the hash it used was in a “ hash function competition” — yes, that’s a thing. The National Institute of Standards and Technology organised the competition to create a new hash standard alongside SHA-2	ethereum
Previous standards had been attacked and debunked. But SHA-2 was unscathed and the NIST simply wanted a safe alternative	
After all, variety is the spice of life (and apparently cryptography). Keccak was just one of several contestants that entered the competition	
During the competition, the team made some minor changes to its algorithms, eventually leading to them being crowned the winner. In other words: SHA-3	
The early Ethereum team had, however, already implemented a non-standardised version of Keccak. Essentially, Ethereum is using a pre-SHA-3 iteration	ethereum

Well, this meant that Ethereum developers needed a custom library — collections of reusable code that needn’t be rewritten from scratch — to accommodate both SHA-3 and Keccak	ethereum
“We’re not compatible with other systems using SHA-3,” Marius van der Wijden, a core Ethereum developer, told DL News . “We have to support both algorithms in the EVM.” It’s essentially been solved	ethereum
Today, big libraries support both encryption mechanisms. So, yeah, big whoop indeed	
“It doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, and current development is definitely not impacted by it,” said van der Wijden. Ethereum’s crack team Despite the list of minor design misses, Buterin said it’s inevitable for any project to have a few	ethereum
“I’m just really happy that I feel like our core devs and their execution capacity feels like it just keeps increasing with each passing year,” he said. “We’re in a position to effectively and safely correct some of these mistakes.” Liam Kelly is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News 	defi
