the following is a conversation with vitalik buterin		
his second time on the podcast vitalik is the co-founder of ethereum		ethereum
and one of the most influential people in cryptocurrency		cryptocurrency
and technology broadly defined quick mention of our sponsors		
athletic greens magic spoon indeed for sigmatic		
and better help check them out in the description to support this podcast		
as a side note let me say that ethereum bitcoin		ethereum, bitcoin
and many other cryptocurrencies have been taking a wild ride of prices going		
up and down in the past few months to me		
the prices were never as important as the ideas both technical		
and philosophical cryptocurrency has the potential to		cryptocurrency
empower billions of people to participate in the global economy in		
a way that resists the manipulation by centralized power		
also with smart contracts layer 2		
technologies data pools nfts and of course integration of artificial		
intelligence into the whole thing we have the opportunity to build tools		
and worlds that transform physical and digital life		
as we know it hopefully minimizing the suffering in		
the world and maximizing the fun this		
is the lex friedman podcast and here is my conversation		
with vitalik buterin let's first talk about		
shiba ino if we can also known as sheba token		token
code shib for contact shiba unu was created in august 2020		
modeled off of doshcoin by the anonymous founder		
known as ryoshi on may 10th this year it had a market capitalization		
of over 13 billion and uh maybe you can explain this but in		
a crazy move you were given half of shibs uh		
total supply you uh burned aka destroyed 90		
of it that's worth 6.7 billion dollars and you donated 10		
that's worth 1.2 billion at the time to an uh india covet 19		
relief fund saying you don't want to be the locus of		
this much power this is uh fascinating		
why and how were you able to walk away from this much money		
and this much power so i i should probably start by		
yeah giving some of the backstory around you know these coins and this concept of		
giving me coins uh so you know first of all you know		
shiba inu as you said is this kind of knockoff of dogecoin		
right and deutsche coin was this initial kind of fun coin that was		
created back i think around 2014 or so and it was just created by jackson		
palmer and like put it out as a joke for a couple of hours and a community formed		
around it and at the beginning people didn't take		
it very seriously i actually remember putting about 25 000		
into doge sometime around 2016 and i just remember		
uh just thinking to myself like okay how am i going to explain my to my mom		
that i just invested 25 000 into dog coins		
and like what even are dog coins like the only interesting thing about this		
coin is that there's you know a logo of a dog somewhere um		
but you know of course that ended up being one of the best investments i've		
ever made and it did really well and then at the		
end of 2020 elon musk of course you know started		
talking about dogecoin and the market cap just like shot up to		
about 50 billion dollars actually and it shot up		
multiple times right like the first time it went up from about		
0.8 cents to about like seven cents and this just happened all in one day		
and i remember um this was when i was still in singapore in the middle		
of uh kovid and you know i saw that the price		
just went up by a thousand percent and i was like oh my god my doge is		
worth like a lot and so i immediately called up some of		
my friends and told them to like drop everything in scramble and i just		
sold half the dosh and i got 4.3 million dollars donated the		
proceeds to give directly and a few hours after i did this the		
price dropped back down from about seven cents to four cents right so i managed		
to sell the doge at the top and i remember just uh		
feeling like i was such an amazing trader but then of course		
you know the price went up from four cents then to seven and then 50 and just		
like doge becoming this big phenomenon where there's even a lot of people that		
have heard of those that have not heard of ethereum is just like something		ethereum
even i wasn't predicting right and so after that of course you know we have		
doge and then people are thinking well you know if the		
leading dog token is worth 50 billion dollars then surely		token
the second largest dog token deserves you know at least seven or eight billion		token
right because i feel like that's the kind of		
what the mindset of these shiba people is um so that of course		
they did this other gimmick right where they gave me half the shiba		
token supply um they were actually not the first projects to do this uh so		token
around the end of 2020 there was this weird project called teller		
it's like t-e-l-l-o-r i think they're a chain-link competitor or something like		
this but i remember they just like dumped		
fifty thousand dollars worth of their token into my wallet		token, wallet
and then they had their twitter arbi just like basically run around saying		
look look at vitalik's wallet vitalik holds		wallet
towers he's one of us he's a supporter and as soon as i discovered this i just		
like publicly sold the tower tokens on you to		
swap and this created a bit of a twitter splat		
now the shiva people were more clever the shiva people instead of dumping to		
that wallet they dumped to my cold wallet		wallet
right so in a cryptocurrency right there's this concept of like cold		cryptocurrency
wallets and hot wallets basically like the thing that actually owns euro		
money is like this 80 digit number called a private key		
right and a hot wallet is when that private key is just stored in memory on		wallet
your computer on your phone really easy to access cold wallet means it's either		wallet
on written down on a piece of paper or it's uh		
on a computer that's just never accessed the internet right so cold is very		
inconvenient but cold is also much more secure right		
because even if that computer has some like viruses on it like it's it's like		
air gap that's not actually going to be able to upload it		
so this cold wallet and like all the money's out of the cold wallet so it's		wallet
safe for me to talk about my setup now right but it was		
a laptop that was sitting in canada and i also had		
um two pieces of paper where i wrote down two numbers on those two pieces of		
paper one was with me one was in canada and if you add those two numbers		
together you get the private key so because of covid travel restrictions		
and you know this is in this cold wallets in canada like it's very		
difficult for me to actually access it right and i'm not		
sure if they knew this maybe they just got lucky but basically they		
you know sent a lot of uh these dog tokens		
into this wallet where i it was very difficult for me to access it but then i		wallet
saw these dot co tokens i saw more and more people		
talking about them and then at some point i realized i		
realized that like hey these things are worth billions of dollars		
and like you know there's lots of really good things that you could do with that		
amount of money and it would actually be a waste to just like see it go so i made		
the decision that like i would actually power through and		
figure out how to like safely like basically get my private key		
um i actually had to call up my family tell them to read out		
their number off of their piece of paper i uh		
entered that into a fresh laptop that i bought from target then i		
put in my other number on my piece of paper added the two numbers together on		
the computer there's the key and at the same time like just scrambled		
for two days setting up a new wallet for to where i		wallet
could move my youth to safely like getting people to be multi-sig		
partners just like doing all sorts of like stuff that you know 10		
years ago you would expect to just be part of a cyberpunk		
you know science fiction novel but you know now it's all real so you're doing		
this all by yourself i essentially most of it		
by myself so you have to keep it secret right and i		
needed my family to um actually like go and read the the		
number on their piece of paper and then i am in my new multisig wallet		wallet
like there's other people that are signatories um but		
you know i'm obviously not going to reveal any		
details beyond that about so i did this right and i actually		
managed to make get the private key make the first		
transaction that would just move all my ether to the multisig wallet so it's		wallet
safe and then second transact put the private		
key on my main computer then started you know like going in and just selling		
some of the dark tokens and then just like giving them to these		
different charities now at the time i actually		
did not even like have any idea of how much you would be able to get right		
because like on paper the dog tokens are seven		
billion dollars but like in reality it's a very liquid market you know		
are you going to crash it by yeah and after you sell 1 million worth you're		
going to crash it after 10 million are you might you actually be able to		
get like an entire 200 million i had no idea um		
so i definitely was just of the mindset like okay i mean i'll sell a bit		
maybe i get some eth and then you know donated some yeast to give well donated		
some to other groups and then okay have some dog tokens like i don't		
have an easy ability to sell more myself but then i'll just		
like give them to these groups and like you know hopefully they'll do good		
things with them um it was actually um i actually donated		
at 20 and dumped 80 percent um yeah so the		
cove the coved um india group got one batch		
and then there's another group that got another batch and		
i don't want to say who they are because i think that		
they want to announce themselves at some point sure yeah but it's uh		
you know you you can see the fact that these transactions were made on the		
blockchain um but it was uh just		blockchain
very intriguing interesting and unexpected and just an insanely crazy		
situation it's been a couple weeks first of all thank you for uh helping me		
uh hang up some curtains this is this is a first for the podcast and uh		
shows uh that you're truly a special person um		
to be willing to help but now a couple weeks later do you		
regret any aspect of that decision um i'm sure there are some things that i		
probably could have done better like i i was actually i was actually talking		
to some of these charities and i was impressed by just		
how much money they managed to get out of selling some of these coins		
so i i probably could have done better by just like		
talking more with the traders and actually ensuring that		
you know that they can do a better job of maximizing the		
the value of uh of uh all of them but like you know it was		
a very stressful time and i did have to		
act quickly like i yeah i did manage to you know make a lot of		
the donations before like a few a few days before the great		
crypto crash happened uh so it was and		crypto
it's difficult to like obviously there's parallel universes in which i did better		
but at the same time there's also lots of parallel universes		
where because i hesitated more and tried to spend more time thinking i		
missed the opportunity uh so you know on that it's like a luck of		
the draw and i'm just you know happy that uh it was		
everything was able to turn out as well as it did but psychologically		
you mentioned stress how hard was it uh it was stressful right i think well		
one of the really stressful parts was just the fact that		
i had to basically move all of my funds you know including the 325		
000 ether from one cold wallet into another hot wallet or sorry into another		wallet
multi-sig wallet um and you know maybe the multisig wallet had a bug in it		wallet
maybe there's like some mistake i'll make in		
the middle that causes the the funds to get lost like you know that's		
that part was stressful and i i was definitely stressing out for two days		
i'm you know triple checking the new wallet i even did a bit of an audit of		wallet
the code myself i wrote my own javascript to adapt to		
make confirmations because gnosis safe didn't work with the		
status wallet well um so there was definite		wallet
that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon um i was also		
a kind of definitely a bit worried about or		
uncertain i guess how the public and you know including the coin communities		
would perceive the whole thing um but i was actually impressed like i		
yeah for every poster that was saying like no		
you know why yeah why did vitalik like rugby on ice he was simple		
his wallet was supposed to be a burn address you know there's like 10 people		wallet
that are like oh you know i thought i was just in this		
because it's a it's a fun pyramid gambling thing but		
instead i ended up being part of this you know great public good thing for		
humanity and that's like even more amazing		
uh so the i the amount of that that i got was		
very impressive so you know all in all let me know i think		
the dog people did great the dog people is there something you can extend		
to the bigger picture of it in the principles you apply to making this		
decision is there some principles philosophies		
that you apply also to uh the decisions you make around		
ethereum um um i think uh a big one for me is just this idea that		ethereum
crypto you know isn't just an opportunity		crypto
to give people like slightly better ways to sit to		
save value and all these things like it's also an opportunity		
to like basically create these like new digital institutions that could		
serve the public good in new ways and and		
that's something that i've been interested in for a long time i actually		
even have this article in bitcoin magazine back in 2014 where i basically		bitcoin
suggested this idea that you know you would have coins that represent causes		
and like people would just like buy and accept those coins because they		
support those causes so i think it's called markets		
institutions and currencies a new form of social incentivization or something		
like that oh my god and i'm sure you can find it and throw		
it in the links um yeah the so that was interesting to kind of		
see becoming real and like in general i mean i think		
you know public goods are very important and on the internet public goods are		
even more important right like every single lex friedman podcast is just		
on youtube and you know anyone can go and see it like there's no way for you		
to like you know sell it and so that some people		
can see it but other people can't see it like you know you could do that but then		
you'd obviously be you know reducing your impact so thank you for making the		
uh the amazing lex freeman podcast still freely available		
well that's actually a tense thing is uh how do you do it in a way that's not uh		
controlled in a centralized fashion because actually		
youtube feels free and open but it nevertheless is one company making		
centralized decisions and the first time i realized youtube was		
not forever is when a lot of the joe rogan		
experience library was pulled from youtube as part of the spotify deal		
and he made me realize we need to uh it's like the realization that fiat		
money is centralized is uh realizing that you know they		
this is not forever and you might want to come up with schemes to distribute it		
to uh decentralize the control of it in a way that audio for podcasters was just		
an rss feed exactly yeah and i think one of the kind		
of philosophical things that i hope to achieve is kind of		
decouple the concept of public goods which are		
incredibly important and are the lifeblood of modern civilization		
from the the idea that there nick is there can be one central organization		
that represents the public and like perfectly unders uh understands and		
can impose their idea of what is the good		
right like it's when people talk about public goods		
it just often comes with this baggage of uh you know either centralization or		
conformism and i think like it doesn't have to		
right like uh often the most important public goods are the		
ones that are created by you know the crazy individual that's		
that disagree with everyone else so trying to make this kind of		
synthesis where you combine the values of decentralization and the values of		
open source but you're not naive about it and like		
you know you realize um that for these things to be produced		
there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable there needs to be		
some way of supporting people who are working these projects but at the same		
time you want to avoid that turning into a vector of		
centralization like trying to sort of get all of the		
good things without the bad things to me that's a yeah a big part of		
sort of what my grand experiment in crypto is about and and		crypto
like we are doing things in different kinds of things for this right like		
there's the the git coin grants quadratic		
funding in the ethereum ecosystem um there's i mean obviously these uh dog		ethereum
coins that just happens like i guess accidentally um there's		
other projects um that like for example you know		
uniswap has um their uniswap dao that just has a huge		dao
amount of funding and like we haven't seen yet how that's		
going to be deployed but you know it could be potentially		
deployed to do lots of really good and amazing things		
do you see ethereum as essentially a mechanism		ethereum
to uh fight for social causes um i definitely see ethereum as		ethereum
being a mechanism to fight for definitely some some specific		
things that are um that are social causes um like		
just you know the fact of creating an open financial system that anyone can		
participate in no matter where they are in the world that's a social cause		
i'm just you know giving people the ability to		
organize and create projects even if it's five people in five different		
countries i think that kind of inclusiveness i think		
that's a social cause and it's a core a core crypto value		crypto
um but then at the same time like the other		
important kind of part of the magic of ethereum that you have to balance that		ethereum
against is that it is also this open platform where ultimately you know		
the thing that go the things that are on ethereum is just		ethereum
the things that the community makes of it		
well you kind of briefly open the door so let's go there		
when it comes to uh government regulation of crypto		crypto
uh what's the best case scenario what's the worst case scenario		
in terms of uh you know as you've kind of mentioned		
ethereum challenges the the the power centers of the world		ethereum
and uh how do you see the interplay between govern		
governments and this new technology that resists centralized power		
best case and worst case the the best case is um that um		
you know blockchains continue to prosper and we figure out scalability is so that		
people can actually start doing things on block all you know all		
of the amazing use cases that people have been talking about instead of today		
where a lot of the great stuff gets priced out		
because you know transaction fees are at five to ten dollars		
and then we see a lot of different um amazing applications happening on		
blockchains you know it could be like dao is creating new ways for people		dao
to inter interact and organize with each		
other new ways for artists to get funded and		
just all sorts of these amazing things and		
there's just enough public um public support and just enough people		
that see that you know look crypto is clearly		crypto
doing a lot of good things and and you know there are definitely areas where		
there's tensions but in those areas where there's		
tensions like there could be some kind of		
creative and interesting approaches that get figured out right like		
you know the concept of corporate taxes for example right like		
you know it does it that would disappear as a revenue stream if theoretically		
corporations just all get replaced by taos but		
i know like maybe there's some other creative		
way by which dao like dao's themselves can kind of be co		dao
you know have some kind of encoded governance that ensures that they		
have at least some of us some kind of bias towards serving the global public		
good and you know maybe it does enough of the		
daos can do enough of that that people are happy with it and and		
you know there are going to be things that people are unhappy about there's		
always going to be the people that you know wants to surveil everyone but		
if on the the kind of effect of crypto from		crypto
just empowering people is greater than that		
and greater than that in a way that people can just easily see		
then you know that would be a good scenario right and we'll just		
like become incorpor kind of incorporated and accepted the same way		
as happened uh with the internet um but the work in the worst case scenario		
would of course be just like people like suddenly you know		
flipping and going into moral panic mode and just		
you know oh my god like this technology is used by like you know		
insert bad group of the day and then i don't think governments have the ability		
to ban crypto to the extent of just		crypto
complete like preventing blockchains from existing but they		
definitely have the ability to really marginalize it right		
like if you just ban all exchanges i can ban all links from the fiat ecosystem to		
crypto and you know you ban all kind of		crypto
mainstream employers from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency		cryptocurrency
then like you could you can successfully like turn it into a		
like you know a fairly kind of niche counterculture thing that		
has much less impact than otherwise would so it's		
somewhere between the good scenario in the bad scenario i'm obviously hoping		
for the good well that's interesting also the tension		
between governments and uh companies like if you have a bunch of		
billionaires or a bunch of companies like tesla investing in bitcoin		bitcoin
and then governments resisting that it's interesting who wins out in that worst		
case scenario and almost when companies		
and uh rich quote unquote respectable people		
embrace uh cryptocurrencies bitcoin ethereum		ethereum, bitcoin
so on even the dot coins uh it's almost sends a signal to everybody else		
that this is this is a revolution that's here to stay		
on this one little tangent that you brought up		
this is almost an outdated idea but it's still with us which is		
cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity for drugs for crime		
and so on is there some sense that worries you that if		
uh if cryptocurrency if ethereum runs the world		ethereum, cryptocurrency
then crime making money from crime will be easier		
there's always that possibility like at the same time i think if you look at you		
know the world as a whole and like the way		
all the other technological trends are going like you		
know in-person surveillance is just going up every year		
right yeah like the if you commit a crime in you know meat space it's		
getting harder and harder to get away with it		
so like you know if he wants to do something		
and and this is something that's just like happening as a result of		
you know just better technology information and information transparency		
like a lot of it's hard to prevent even if		
you really tried um so i the world		
where like things go dark to such an ex you know as the the one the police hawks		
sometimes like to say um to such an extent		
that like you know oh my god the criminals are committing crimes with		
impunity and we can't see anything like that just seems		
unlikely um but you know on the other hand like		
the world uh where there just you know is no privacy for example or		
um the world where there just like is no no ability to uh kind of act		
outside of the the confines of you know mainstream institutions like		
it's uh some that's something that's more realistic and that seems like		
something that uh could lead to a lot of kind of		
a lot of scary things right and like even from a government's point of view		
right like i think governments over the last few years a		
lot of them they're very worried about sovereignty you know they're worried		
about like if their um country is economies and you		
know social environments they're just completely		
dependent on basically foreign tech companies		
controlled by foreign governments like you know governments are not on team		
government right that's like you know the indian government is on you know		
team india you know the russian government is on		
team russia and so forth right so like you know they don't want the us to		
be able to like have this big backdoor into everything		
uh so i mean i do think that a balance is needed but		
at the same time i uh do and think um i guess		
i i definitely like worry more about the messiah the possibility that		
just like without things like crypto uh kind of acting outside of		crypto
institutions becomes too impossible and i don't even necessarily mean		
outside of governments even just you know outside of corporations like		
becomes too impossible and there's just like terrible things that come as a		
result um and if things going in the other		
direction like it obviously is a a risk but		
you know at the same time i think in the long term like a crypto can		crypto
potentially even like offer defenses as much as attacks against that sort of		
thing yeah many throughout history many of the		
most destructive things came from centralized institutions versus		
sort of from the people operating in the shadows		
and you know i've been talking to a bunch of psychedelics folks		
that people doing researchers like greg doblin		
in johns hopkins there's a lot of exciting research on psychedelics		
and one thing you could say about operating at the edge of legality		
it could actually accelerate the adoption of particular things like		
whether it's marijuana or psychedelics they can help people out it almost		
accelerates the policy it forces the policy to catch up to		
where the people stand right so there's a positive way of doing		
things that are in the gray area of legality		
and creating a market that allows people to to uh		
in a safe way be able to participate in this gray area		
yeah i mean the other thing to keep in mind of course is that the		
the set of like the kinds of things that just like payment processors as		
companies try to restrict people you from is much larger than the		
set of things that's illegal right right like part of that is because they		
want to be super conservative and like the more layers you have the more		
they're like kids conservative because they're scared		
of what what the layer below them will do to them		
sometimes they have their own you know moral opinions of various kinds		
you know they go after lots of people right like they make life really hard		
for you know like sex workers for example		
and like you know psychedelics as you mentioned		
there's uh like a lot of activity even including stuff that is		
totally legal that just you know there's this like		
you know shadow like paypal credit card governments or whatever you want to call		
it and no no that makes it just hard to		
participate in this stuff so i think like reducing the number of		
intermediaries is definitely normally a good thing all right let's		
talk about one of the most exciting uh technologies like technically		
philosophically like socially financially in every way		
which is ethereum 2.0 there's a million things to talk		ethereum
about but at the step one is probably a good thing to do		
which is can you briefly summarize your vision		
how ethereum 2.0 will make ethereum more scalable		ethereum
secure and sustainable sure so i think recently we've actually been		
kind of de-emphasizing the eth 2.0 branding i guess so the reason		
behind that was that originally we envisioned something more		
like a big grand event where you know all the good things would		
happen at the same time and it would be a new blockchain		blockchain
and it would be a new protocol and people would have to take a lot of		protocol
effort to migrate over but later we've slowly changed the		
roadmap over to something that's much more incremental		
right so you know proof of stake happens kind of over time and then sharding gets		
added over time and all these features get added over time		
and so the experience for just a regular ethereum user		ethereum
still feels very seamless right it's like maybe a little bit more complex		
than the hard forks that we've already done but from a user's point of view but		
like not by that much right uh so like		
the big two things that are happening right these are		
what used to be considered the two flagship features of use 2.0 and now		
they're just you know the flagship features of the you know		
the next uh evolution of ethereum yeah as uh proof		ethereum
of stake and sharding right so proof of stake is		
a consensus algorithm it's the or it's not just mechanism i		
should say um it's the difference is that like an algorithm		
is something that you run by yourself a mechanism		
is like it involves interactions between people and it could even include		
incentives and all of that uh so the consensus mechanism		
uh so by which nodes in the network agree on you know which		
blocks came in which transactions came in in what order		
uh make sure that once a block gets accepted it can't get reverted and all		
of these things that we expect from a blockchain		blockchain
um so existing blockchains you know including bitcoin including the ethereum		ethereum, bitcoin
of today and including a lot of them they use proof of work		
right uh so the reason why we need proof of anything		
is be it is because like they serve this function that i call kind of economic		
civil resistance so that's obviously you know a big word		
for especially if you've never heard of		
sybil's before but like the basic idea is right that you have a network and you		
have lots of computers that agree on like which block to accept and		
sometimes you get you know two blocks that get published at the same time and		
you just have to agree on an order so there has to be some kind of voting game		
yeah but then the question is well in this voting game you know who get who		
gets a vote who gets to participate now the pro you can't say one person one		
vote right the reason why you cannot say one person one vote is because		
you need some kind of like authority or some kind of mechanism to say you know		
who the the humans are like and if you don't		
have that then a bad guy could just come in with a		
virtual machine or with a computer that has		
on it 10 billion virtual machines that have 10 billion you know virtual nodes		
and then just like say look i'm 99 of the network i should control everything		
uh so to prevent this what proof of work and proof of stake both do		
is they basically say well the weight of your vote like how much influence		
your votes have in the consensus is proportional to like what quantity of		
economic resources you bring in so in the case of proof of work you		
prove what economic resources you have because your economic resources are		
computers and you prove that you have them by just		
running them 24 7 using these hash algorithms right so this does		
solve the problem right because in order to		
attack the network you have to come in with more computers		
and more money invested into computers and electricity		
than the rest of the network puts together and that's extremely expensive		
in proof-of-stake instead of relying on people with computers that are		
just constantly cranking out hashes 24 7 you		
as you're like a unit of economic resources you just use		
like holdings of coins inside the system right so all of these blockchains they		
have some kind of coin in them bitcoin has bitcoin ethereum has ether		ethereum, bitcoin
um you know they all have a coin so why not just use that as the economic		
the economic resource that you're using to like measure participation		
um so that's like the quarry distinction between proof of work and		
proof of stake um i like proof of stake and i've liked		
proof of stake for many years basically because like it just requires		
much less ongoing resource consumption right		
like with proof-of-work um you know you have to like actually go		
and buy these physical computers and these days um you know yeah they		
have specialized hardware asics um application specific integrated circuits		
you have to go produce them you have to go buy them and unless you have millions		
of dollars you know you have to buy them from one of these other people who		
creates them and those other people often end up		
taking a huge cut of the profits themselves		
uh and then you know you have to plug them in you have to just		
burn all of this electricity that's just um running 24 7. so		
it consumes a huge amount of energy right and it gets not just energy it		
also you know just to create the hardware		
right like people focus a lot on energy but like actually		
about half the cost of proof of work mining is the cost of the hardware		mining
um so hardware is a very big deal too um and you know you need		
this like these this really big and powerful with very specialized hardware		
another kind that fills up these big warehouses		
so proof of stake you don't you don't really need that much electricity you		
just need just a little bit to run right to run a regular computer		
um you can run proof-of-stake validators on computers that you already have		
um so it's just much less resource intensive and like this is		
good for a few reasons right like one is you know the kind of environmental		
rationale that you know you're not breaking the		
environment um the second is that you're not taking away		
electricity and like other resources from other		
people i mean like right now there's i think just today i saw a story about		
like iran wanting to shut down some bitcoin mining because		bitcoin, mining
it was just grabbing up so much electricity that it was you know		
outbidding the nearby towns and they just		
didn't have enough um and then there was like chia that was the one that's doing		
proof of like hard disk mining basically it's just like grabbing up so many hard		mining
disks there's a there's a shortage right so		
that's the second reason and then the third more selfish reason is that		
because participating in consensus does not require so much energy		
expenditure you don't need to pay people as much to participate		
right so like bitcoin and ethereum they both issue		ethereum, bitcoin
somewhere around four percent of the total supply every year right now		
to miners so ethereum is about 4.7 million ether		ethereum
and the current supply is about 115 million but with proof of stake like we		
expect it'll be somewhere between 500 000 and one and one million per year		
um so so that means you know this the supply doesn't have to you know		
increase so quickly um so one of the pros that uh		
that people sort of argue for the proof of work is that uh it is secure because		
it's much more difficult to sort of as you've highlighted is		
difficult to participate is there um is what are your thoughts		
about the security of the proof-of-stake mechanism		
is is there ways to make it secure so i think proof of stake is very secure uh		
because in order to be able to attack the system		
you need to have like basically as much stake as the rest of		
the network right so that means like right now for example		
we have five million each staking so you have to come up with five million each		staking
and then join the network and then the the other so five million		
ethers a lot right it's like um how much is it now like 15 billion		
dollars so that's actually more than i i believe the cost of attacking the		
bitcoin network and then the second thing is that		bitcoin
recovering from attacks is much easier in proof-of-stake than proof-of-work		
right because in proof-of-stake you have like first of		
all we have for many kinds of attacks that you do against this network		
we have this concept of like automatic slashing right which basically means		
that in order to like revert a finalized		
block so if there's one block that's like		
accepted by the network and you try to convince the network to		
kind of revert that block and accept a different block in order to make that		
kind of attack you basically have to have your		
validator like a big portion of your validators		
signed to conflicting messages and this is something that like once		
these messages are on the network you can go and prove like		
look these people did it and so we have this feature in the protocol		protocol
called slashing where you basically take all these people who provably misbehaved		
and you burn their coins right and you don't burn anyone else's		
coins now there are other cases like for example		
if instead of reverting blocks the attack just tries to censor everyone		
right then what you do everyone who got censored would just like basically		
create the minority chain um and then the community would		
basically have to do a soft fork right they would just have to say like look		
this chain is clearly attacking us this chain is		
the one not attacking us and so we're going to join this chain		
and then what happens is that on that new chain the attackers also lose a lot		
of coins right yeah so the difference between		
proof of stake and proof of work is that in a proof-of-stake system like		
you can identify specific participants and you can say you know		
these and like this isn't like you know a human going in and saying i don't like		
you i don't like you i don't like you this is like automated right		
you can so the slashing process is automated yes		
is there ways it can go wrong so that's a painful process where the coins are		
burned um it is painful yes i think uh		
i mean the one big unknown of course is like if		
an attack actually happens and like if an attack happens that requires the		
community to actually choose one of these minority forks		
then like what would the the community actually successfully coordinating on		
this look like right like it's like you know we can talk about it		
and we can you know write like science fiction novels about it but		
like until it's happened you don't really know the details of like what it		
looks like and how difficult it is what are the s of communication		
for the community if you can enlighten me a little bit like what you		
know uh in many ways in the political realm		
twitter is often used as a way to kind of have these emerging phenomena of		
large groups of people coming to a consensus right about a particular idea		
and then there's battle for consensus what's uh		
in the ethereum community how do people what are the sources of natural language		ethereum
based communication that have an emergent belief structure		
that you would say or is it all through money is it all		
through trading that the communication happens		
there's definitely talking as well um i mean like we have to agree on protocol		protocol
changes somehow right like there's twitter there's reddit		
there's um github there's uh all of the various ethereum forums		ethereum
ethereum magicians ethereum research there's just in-person communication		ethereum
then there's just kind of like the hidden web of everyone talking to		
everyone on telegram um or signal uh so it's like some of		
everything right but i think like the thing to		
emphasize around like can you actually come to consensus on		
you know whether or not to fork the chain because the attacker is		
censoring some everyone just for example is like		
you everyone who's running a node is going to see		
almost the same thing right like they're going to be off by a few seconds and		
like maybe they'll be off by a few they'll disagree by a few minutes but		
like if it's a serious attack you know people are gonna know right it's not		
like one of those things where you know oh		
it we're trying to agree on like i don't know did epstein kill himself or like		
some you know read the political facts for like in		
reality no one knows a single thing about what's actually going on and		
they're all speculating like it is much more visible right so we		
do have that but you know at the same time i'm happy		
to admit that like these are fairly untested mechanisms but		
like at the same time they're also untested mechanisms and proof of work		
right and like in proof of work it's even		
harder because in proof of work you don't have the ability to like identify		
and say like you know i'm going to these miners		
attacked and so we're not going to let these my um		
these miners in these miners do not attack so we're going to keep them in		
like you have to pretty much you know either take out none of the miners or		
you do a fork that changes the proof of work algorithm which takes out all of		
the miners right so the the economics of like recovering		
from attacks and proof of work at least to me		
actually do seem more unfavorable but you know i'm sure the proof of work		
people you talk to will give a very different and contradictory opinions and		
that's totally fine and amazing some people		
describe mev minor extractable value as an		
existential risk to ethereum what is mev how important is it to solve		ethereum
an mvv if it's important what ideas do you have		
sure how about after this one we'll also talk about sharding because that's		
amazing and it's part of the return back to sharding and		
which is no no return to the big picture of the scaling problem as you mentioned		
i love this conversation you know depth first search instead of brett first		
so uh basically okay ebbyv minor extractable value um it is not		
different in proof of work and proof of stake right so like if you want to call		
it you know block proposal extractable		
value like it sounds a lot sexy but you know we can call it bpef instead of math		
who cares um but so this is a problem in both		
proof of work and proof of stake yes so the basic idea is		
that if you have the ability to choose which transactions go into a block and		
in what order then you have the ability to like take		
advantage of that position for economic gain		
in a lot more ways than just collecting transaction fees right		
like for example there's decentralized exchanges on chain like uniswap		decentralized
and like let's say the price of eth versus usdc was 2700		
the previous block but then there was a bit of a market drop and now it's 26.80		
where you can go on unit swap and you can just like gobble up the entire part		
of um you know the automated order book		
that's like between 2700 and 26.80 right and that's		
and then at the same time you like run a bot and uh		
you know you buy some yeast back at 26.80 and you've just like made about 10		
dollars of profit right so or well 10 dollars times you know		
whatever the depth is right so and so there's lots of um little things like		
that there's also things um that involve like front running other people's		
transactions so one example of this would be		
that if someone sends a transaction that says		
buy me five eth for um whatever price that you can get um then		
but with a maximum of let's say yeah uh 15 000 then you can go		
and like you can send each put a transaction		
right in front of that transaction and you can like buy up that east first		
and then you resell it to him at you know fifteen thousand dollars minus one		
yeah so there's then you get to make a little bit of money though exactly so		
there's a lot of these different like arbitrage front running back running		
these different tricks that allow block proposers to to get		
some percentage on top like overhead exactly and the		
reason why this is um a challenge is because um		
it's like first of all it's some it sometimes degrades		
user experience because users get you know less favorable uh		
trades but there are sometimes ways to like mitigate that for applications		
sometimes it's not that bad but like the bigger risk that i think		
some people consider more existential is that there's just much more economies		
of scale in figuring out how to extract all this		
revenue i mean because if you're just collecting transaction fees		
there aren't really economies of scale there aren't really benefits to		
centralizing right because it's a very simple formula you just like grab up the		
transactions that pay you the most but with mev you know you ha there's all		
these sophisticated algorithms and if you have lots of money then you		
can hire really smart people to make amazing algorithms and then you can use		
the other half of your money to get a lot of mining power a lot of		mining
stake and you get a lot of opportunities to use your even better algorithms		
so there's this risk that like as a result of this		
mining is basically or or even validating proof of stake is going to		mining
centralize um so i think the ecosystems best reply		
to this sort of risk and it's the direction where projects		
like flashbots are going already is if you can't eliminate the		
centralization then you try to firewall it right and the way that you		
fire wallet is you basically say we're going to try to deliberately create a		wallet
marketplace where people can just do the complicated work		
of creating what are called bundles like bundles of		
transactions that like are very profitable right and then		
at the other side of the market you just have like block proposes reminders that		
are just dumb nodes and they go and ask the what are called		
searchers the bundle creators and they just ask like hey like how much		
can you give me if i put in your bundle and then they just take the highest		
offer right so you sort of separate out the		
task and you know you have the easy part and then you have the hard		
part and you have like this special class of actor called a searcher that		
does the hard part and then the easy part the people doing		
the easy part which is just miners and validators they kind of		
just talk to all the different people doing the searching and they just you		
know accept the highest bidder right so and this is also just like		
interesting uh an interesting example of like economic design philosophy		
right like sometimes you can't just like make centralization go away sometimes		
it's inevitable but you know at least you can try to kind of		
contain it you can direct it or you know you can even sort of		
firewall it away from you know core consensus the parts that		
really do need to be decentralized so but you don't see it as an		decentralized
existential risk it's just incredible it's a bit of a problem that it has to		
be constantly dealt with it's a i mean it's a risk like there's		
obviously a risk that you know there it it's a very severe problem and that even		
this flashbots approach has some fatal flaw or whatever		
um but i'm definitely like we're definitely approaching it with the		
mindset of you know this is a problem and like yes we do have to do some work		
to solve it but we're doing it and uh so far it's being solved okay let's talk		
about the other really really fascinating part of uh		
the future of ethereum let's not call it ethereum 2.0		ethereum
but the future of ethereum that also may require a hard fork i don't know you can		ethereum
correct me on this is well broadly		
ideas for scaling yes and more specifically		
sort of uh layer two or uh layer one and two intersection ideas of		
how to achieve scaling and at the core of that is the idea of		
sharding so first what is sharding okay		
uh so there's two major paradigms for scaling blockchains right as		
you said layer one and layer two and layer one basically means		
make the blockchain itself like capable of processing more transactions by		blockchain
having you know some mechanism by which you can do that		
despite the fact that there's a limit to the capacity of each participant in the		
blockchain and then layer two says well we're gonna		blockchain
keep the blockchain as is but we're gonna create clever protocols		blockchain
that sit on top of the blockchain that still use the blockchain and then		blockchain
still kind of inherit things like the security guarantees of a blockchain		blockchain
but at the same time a lot of things are done off-chain and so		
you get more scalability that way um so in ethereum the most popular paradigm		ethereum
failure too is rollups and the most popular paradigm for		
one is sharding so one way to achieve layer one scaling is to increase the		
block size yes hence the block size wars quote		
unquote and uh you actually tweeted something about		
uh people are saying that vitalik changed his mind about the in it		
he went from being a small i went from being big to small		
big small of them and uh but you said i've been a medium		
blocker all along so maybe you can also comment on on where		
on the very basic aspect before you even get the sharding of where you stand on		
this block size debate sure so the way that i think		
about the trade-off is i think about it as a trade-off between		
making it easy to write to the blockchain and making it easy to read		blockchain
the blockchain right so when i say read i just mean you		blockchain
know have a node and actually verify it and make sure that it's correct and all		
of those things and then by right i mean send		
transactions so like i think for decentralization it's		
important for both of these tasks to be accessible		
and i think that they're like about equally important right if you have a		
chain that's too expensive to read then everyone will just trust a few people to		
like read for them and then those people can change the rules without anyone		
else's permission but if on the other hand it becomes		
really expensive to write then everyone will move on to basically		
second layer systems that are incredibly centralized and like that takes away		
from you know decentralization and		
self-sovereignty as well so this has been my viewpoints like pretty		
much the whole time right it's that like you know you need this balance and going		
in one direction or the other direction is very unhealthy		
in the bitcoin case um basically what happens was that		bitcoin
bitcoin originally like at the very beginning it didn't really have a block		bitcoin
size it just had an accidental block size of 32 meg or a		
block size limit of 32 megabytes because that just happens to be the limit of the		
peer-to-peer messages um but that's interesting i didn't even		
know that part yeah but then um satoshi back in 2010 was worried that		
even 32 megabyte blocks would be too hard to process so he		
uh put the limit down to one megabyte and you know i think		
the i put you mean sneaked in there yeah just like made an update to the bitcoin		bitcoin
software that made blocks bigger than one i think it's		
a million bytes um invalid and i think the impression that most people		
had at the time is that you know this is just		
a temporary safety measure and over time you know though as we become more		
confident in the software that limit would be		
and like raised some uh somewhat um but ba then		
of when the actual usage of the blockchain started going up		blockchain
and then it started going up first to 100 kilobytes		
per block then to 250 kilobytes per block then to 500 kilobytes per block		
um you know they're started kind of coming out of the woodworks this opinion		
that like no that limit should just not be increased		
and and you know then there are all of these attempts at compromising right		
um you know first there's like a proposal for 20 megabyte blocks then		
there was the 248 proposal which is um a bit ironic because the 248		
proposal started off being like a small block negotiating position		
but then when the big black people came back and said like hey where are we are		
we gonna do this they're like oh no no no we don't want them we don't want the		
block size increases anymore uh so you know there were these two		
different positions right the small blockers		
i think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons		
one is that they just like really really believe in the importance of		
being able to read the chain but two is that a lot of them		
really believe in in maintaining this norm of never hard forking		
right right so the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is basically		
that in a soft fork um blocks that were		
any block that's valid under the new rules was still valid under the old		
rules so if you have a client that verifies		
according to the old rules then you'll still be able to accept the chain		
that follows the new rules whereas with a hard fork like you have to		
update your code in order to stay on the chain		
and look they have this belief that you know soft forks are kind of either		
less coercive than hard forks which by the way i completely disagree with		
um i actually think soft forks are more coercive because like basically they		
force everyone who disagrees to sort of go along by default		
um but or they have this um opinion that um there's like		
it's more difficult to abuse soft forks to do really mean things like or		
that like completely violate people's expectations like increasing the supply		
which is again there i think there is some truth to that um		
so because of you know these reasons they just say we're only going to do		
soft forks and we don't we wants to just not do any hard		
forks and they eventually discovered this idea		
called segregated witness that allows for like a very tiny		
block size increase to like the equivalent of about two megabytes		
um with a soft fork it's it's just a really		
like weird and devious trick like basically what they do is		
they take the signatures of transactions and then they put them outside of the		
block and then they add an extra rule that		
says that like every for a block to be valid the blog has to come with		
a separate like basically extension block that contains all of the		
transaction signatures right so you know when you measure it		
according to the old rules like you know hey it adds up to less than a million		
but actually there's this extension block that		
the old protocol doesn't even know about so it's a hack that that seemed to work		protocol
to do in a small way extend exactly but so		
you know small block side was like happy with these very low levels of block size		
and the big block side wanted to expand to you know at the very least go		
to four megabytes then you know maybe go maybe eight twenty there are there's		
disagreements within there as well um i definitely was uh favoring the big		
side um the whole way through as you can		
probably tell um but even though so the argument		
against the big is that uh it uh makes things more		
centralized yes because fewer people can run and		
know that verifies the chain and also because any of these things		
would require a hard fork and you know hard forks or inherently risky		
do you think there's truth to that um i'm pro hard fork i think hard forks		
are actually like in a yeah you know political economic		
sense they're better than soft forks well let's okay okay i think it's a		
beautiful principle as stated that soft		
forks may be more coarse coercive than hard forks		
this this is not just about cryptocurrency this is about		cryptocurrency
politics and life that's fascinating so you're okay with hard forks in fact you		
think hard forks is the right way to make changes because		
then everybody's forced to make a decision		
right do you accept this change or not as opposed to ideas being sneaked		
in behind the door and you're and the decisions forced on you		
exactly yeah okay so but you know hard fork some people say this is when		
they talk about sort of ethereum is there's some aspect to a hard fork		ethereum
where you're trying to upgrade a what is it airplane while it's		
flying and uh i think softworks are also		
upgrading an airplane while it's flying but it's just smaller upgrades		
that's like there's some truth to that like		
there's definitely um there's definitely a bit more risk of like a split as a		
result of a hard fork then as a result of a soft		
fork um and this split is highly undesirable right		
well it depends like if it's a split because of a bug then that's horrible		
if it's a split as a result of political differences then i think like		
a split is better than you know one side being forced to basically just like suck		
it up and accept the majority position even if it		
really hates it well there's also political connections		
throughout the history of the united states it's like sometimes		
groups of people that strongly disagree with each other		
should be forced to work it out even if they even when a split seems		
like an easy thing in the short term it depends and i think like well for		
blockchains in particular the costs of people being able to like peacefully do		
their go off and do their own thing or much lower right like		
you know okay if you have a country and you have two groups then		
like often enough like fighting out the new rules requires		
you know a civil war it requires everyone to move and so forth but no no		
on a blockchain like you know the costs are lower and so so if you		blockchain
were to look at the way things worked out with the block size wars		
and there was a split what is the bitcoin cash and bitcoin		bitcoin
yeah um would you like you looking putting on your historian hat		
you mentioned offline you like dan carlin		
so if dan carlin went to do an episode on the		
on the block size wars uh do you think uh it could have turned out better or do		
you um are you okay with the way it turned		
out i'm definitely disappointed with what		
happened with the block with the the big block side		
um i think the source of my disappointment is that like		
one of the things that you notice when just looking at like this political		
disagreements generally especially when you have environments where you know		
they're authoritarian or like single party		
dominated and then there's some opposition party		
and the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances		
but at the same time the thing you notice is that often enough the		
opposition just sucks right like it just doesn't have		
you know political capacity it doesn't have like the ability to		
come up with policy because its entire culture is like designed around		
resisting much more and then it's designed around like you know		
actually debating serious policy trade-offs and		
i i worry or i guess not so much worry because it's already happened		
i uh unfortunately think that bitcoin cash ended up being a victim of this		bitcoin
right like um first no there was a split with bitcoin cash and then of course		bitcoin
craig wright came in and you know craig wright was uh this		
basically scammer who just keeps on pretending that he is satoshi nakamoto		
the inventor of uh bitcoin hey craig wright's legal team do you hear me yes i		bitcoin
still think your client is a scammer so sue me this is definitely gonna be		
depth first search because i gotta ask you about craigslist		
because these people have been contacting me and i'm trying to figure		
out like what is up with this human being so for		
people who don't know there's somebody who is let's start		
there's satoshi nakamoto who is the creator of bitcoin is anonymous		bitcoin
and actually most really big people in the cryptocurrency space		cryptocurrency
do not like like yourself and others do not dare claim that they are even for		
fun satoshi nakamoto in fact if satoshi nakamoto is still		
alive and is like if say you were satisfied it seems like		
the thing he would do is probably or she is uh		
trying to remain anonymous on the flip side of that there's a guy named		
craig wright who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact satoshi		
nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people so uh		
on on him if we could just linger on him what do you make of this character		
uh what what are we supposed to make of this character		
should he be ignored is there any possible truth to his claims		
um what do you make of him the the analogy that's at the side at the top of		
my head will get a bit political but um that's fine you've had michael ballas		
um so um i guess i view craig wright as being		
kind of like a donald trump figure yes and that like he's not very		
intellectual um but i think he gets a big audience		
because he says he he says things that like play to the resentments that		
people have and he says things that uh people wants to hear right like in		
the in the wake of this block size war no the big blockers did feel very		
disenchanted like they felt that you know bitcoin always had this vision		bitcoin
that we were supposed to just keep increasing the block size and bitcoin is		bitcoin
pewter pure cash it says so in the white paper		
and then this gr this elitist clique of core devs just like		
came in and said you know no no we're going to impose this totally different		
vision and if you ever want your scalability		
you'll have to wait for us to create this		
this totally unproven fancy technology called the lightning network that works		
on your completely different principles and you know they were very angry at		
this and i mean i think like i think a lot of that anger is justified		
um but at the same time you know when people are in that mental		
state like it's very easy for you to just kind of like latch on		
and if you find someone who expresses anger at the same things that you're		
angry at and also like it seems like someone		
who's strong and seems like someone who you know might be good to rally around		
it's very easy to just like get behind that		
but that extra part about where he satoshi		
i think that's um he could have done it without that but that		
i mean that just it's a marketing strategy like it sort of gives him more		
salience like there's other big block personalities		
right but what's the difference between with greg wright he's not just a big a		
big block personality he's potentially satoshi um and he did say		
all the big block things right like he talked about how oh the concept of a fee		
market is fundamentally like economically wrong and it should be		
it should be a free market and you should be able to have walks as big as		
you want like he repeated all the talking points and so		
a lot of people were kind of sucked into that right		
and so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate		
a big part of the bitcoin cash community for a long time and then		bitcoin
eventually if of course um you know more and more people started to catch on		
um he would just say technical things that are completely wrong right		
like one example of this that i remember is that he mixed up		
the concept of 256 bits and 2 to the power of 256 bits		
right um so you know the difference is it's like the difference between you		
know 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers		
right um and because of this like he made this made this argument that said		
that bitcoin that bitcoin's elliptic curve is		bitcoin
friendly to cryptographic pairings like you don't have to		cryptographic
understand what that is but if you want to know i have articles on both at		
vitalik.ca um but basically he made this like		
technical argument that really hedged on this point and then when people when		
people pressed him on it's like yes what no no like what look exactly		
the the height is like what two and two to the 256 bits that's uh		
a very uh a very tiny amount of information no no no 2256 bits is more		
than the amount of information in the universe		
and like yeah you know equivocated and kind of like		
preyed on people's inability to and you know understands that mathematical		
nuance and i called him out and eventually i even called him out in		
person at this conference and soul like i just stood up		
and asked the you know hey you know conference		
organizer why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference		
and i remember even some big blockers at the time getting angry at me		
um but you know eventually they i did get rid of him and then craig well		
basically craig wright um was forced to split off because the		
rest of the community refused to accept some network change that he wanted		
and so then there was the bch and bsv and then in the bitcoin cash community		bitcoin
there was this drama of are they going to add a developer fund		
where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue from the miners		
to the devs and according to the libertarian not		
aggression principle is this technically theft		
um like his um understanding of the technical depths of cryptocurrency		cryptocurrency
was lacking in a way that you uh satoshi nakamoto certainly would not		
yes exactly but the point is that even after craig wright got expunged		
the bitcoin cash community kept having these disagreements right and now		bitcoin
after this uh development funds dispute there's there's a further split between		
bitcoin cash and abc um so you know the the the brand check		bitcoin
three continues to extend right so so in that way it's disappointing to		
see those kinds of splitting there was never a result it is i would		
have definitely like wanted to see more of a kind of		
like v principled coin with a like tries to be bitcoin but but you		bitcoin
know follows consistent big block values but yeah i know maybe i should just like		
stop expecting projects that i have no involvement and to		
uh care at all about what my values are and you know like maybe ethereum just		ethereum
like is is never i think you have a powerful		
voice and you can inspire other projects to do		
to to to live up to their best possible cells		
okay so that's the level that's the layer one uh approach		
the other layer one within the ethereum is the idea of sharding yes		ethereum
what the heck is sharding okay what does the future of shining look like right so		
to summarize that big long tangent that we just uh once it's a		
beautiful tangent button it's tangent and i think like crypto is		crypto
just uh one of the most underrated aspects of		
crypto is i think how you can like analyze the you know the sociology		crypto
and the politics and the anthropology and		
yeah and i'm sure dan carl would have fun exploring the space at some point		
but like the core trade-off right is that if you scale blockchains the dumb		
way just by increasing the parameters then eventually you just make it harder		
and harder to participate as a node and you		
end up with a system where there's like 20 computers running the whole thing		
and it's just very centralized um so shorting basically says well		
instead of just increasing the parameters what we're going to do is		
we're going to change the blockchain architecture		blockchain
in such a way that each individual node in the blockchain only		blockchain
needs to store a small portion of the data and only		
needs to process a small portion of the transactions		
so you can think about it as being like inspired by bitsword right like on		
bittorrent there's no such thing as a bittorrent full node that has every		
movie right you know the work is like split up		
among a huge number of computers and like that makes sense that's uh you know		
the only sane way to scale a system like that		
um and if they actually tried making a version bit of bits or that required		
full nodes that store every movie then you know it		
would have like zero censorship resistance and it would just like		
you know be dead in an instant uh so the challenge with taking that model and		
applying it to blockchains right is that blockchains aren't just about like		
spreading data around they're about agreeing on exactly what data was spread		
around and ensuring that everything that you agree on actually is		
correct and so you have this paradox where		
let's say you want to have a system that supports		
10 000 transactions a second but each computer in the network can only		
personally verify 100 transactions a second so how can		
each computer get a guarantee about the other 900		
without actually going and verifying them themselves yep		
and it turns out that there are some um like a bundle of different tricks that		
can do that right so like one of them is uh just random sampling		
so the idea behind random sampling is like let's		
say for simplicity this is a proof of stake chain and		
you have 10 000 validators validators like		
you know the stakers and like for simplicity we'll assume they all have		
the same number of coins right if someone has more coins we'll just kind		
of split them up and pretends they're tense takers		
then you you you do like some random shuffling and you basically say		
these random hundred validators are assigned to validate this		
block these random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block		
these random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block		
and so each individual computer only gets assigned to validate like a small		
piece but then the way that the information		
about like what's evaluated gets passed around right is that when		
these hundred participants validate a block		
they all sign a message basically saying like yes		
we agree that this block is valid and then like they combine that signature		
into one and then they broadcast that signature		
and then everyone else instead of verifying the blocks directly		
just verifies that signature right and so if i see the signature i'm		
not directly convinced that that block is valid but what i am convinced of is		
that out of this committee of or this		
randomly selected group of 100 validators let's say		
at least 70 of them agree that this block is valid and so if i trust that		
you know the majority of these participants are all honest		
then because it's all randomly selected you know the attacker can't just like		
force themselves into one committee and and so you know the attacker is		
going to be even at least evenly spread out too and so if you know		
the entire set of validators is mostly honest every committee is going to be		
mostly honest and so like bad blocks are not going to go		
through right so that's like one simple form of sharding there's also		
other more clever things that you can do so for example there's this concept of		
zk snarks right now called as your knowledge proofs so this is the idea		
that you can make a cryptographic proof that says		cryptographic
i verified or i ran some complex computation on this piece		
of data and i got this answer and so if you make these kinds of proofs		
then like if you see a zika snark that says some block is valid		
then you're convinced that that block is valid and		
even if you know everyone in that committee is evil like they have no way		
of making a a valid proof for a bad block		
right like because the proof itself like it is a proof that you did the		
computation where that proof is much easier to		
verify than just running the computation yourself		
and you know the there's once again you know super		
awesome mathematical cryptographic magic behind		cryptographic
making zk snarks work um so it gives you a little bit of a leg		
up over the 51 honest exact assumption so it's a little		
hack that improves upon the random sampling thing		
exactly and like there's other hacks right like there is another hack called		
data availability sampling that allows you to make sure that the data in the		
blocks was actually published but like basically like if you stack a		
couple of these tricks on top of each other		
you can create a system where like i as an individual participant		
can be convinced that everything that's going on in this distributed blockchain		blockchain
thing is correct without actually personally checking more than like a		
percent of it so that's charting that's starting but		
but the as i understand maybe correct me on this		
is uh in the space of ethereum the the sharding happens on some fixed		ethereum
number like th the split is on some fixed		
number i think it's 64. is the currently sort of proposed number		
so um how does that help scaling is it just		
to fix constant scaling by 64 and is that a way		
to achieve those crazy the crazy amount of scaling that		
seems to be required to use cryptocurrency for uh for		cryptocurrency
purchasing so doing like competing with credit cards		
and visa and so on right so first i think like the 64 can be hard forked up		
over time um so we have uh set it so that like		
there's theoretically space in the data structure for 1024		
shards it's just that 64 of them are turned on		
um like there are challenges with having more shards because like you have to		
have logic that just like checks and manages all		
of those shards and if there's too many of them then that becomes too expensive		
um but you know even still you can improve quite a bit		
and then the other thing that we're doing is if		
what we're getting maximum scalability by combining		
roll-ups and sharding right so this might be a good time to talk about		
roll-ups what are roll-ups okay and now we're		
moving into layer two ideas yes so the idea behind a roll-up		
is basically that so instead of um just publishing		
transactions directly on chain and having everyone you know do all of		
the checking of those transactions and what you do is you create a system		
where users send their transactions to some		
part like central party called an aggregator and		
like well theoretically you can have a system where like the aggregator		
switches around or anyone can be an aggregator so		
you know it's still like permissionless to send things um		
then what the aggregator does is they strip out all of the transaction data		
that like is not relevant to helping people		
update the state so when i say the state this is like this is a very important		
kind of technical term for blockchains i mean like		
account balances code um like things that are like memory		
internal memory of smart contracts like basically everything the blockchain		blockchain
actually has to keep track of and remember right so		
you just put in you take all these transactions strip		
out all the data that's not relevant to telling people how to update the state		
and then you take the data that's needed to update the state and then you like		
really compress it right so like for example		
if we say you know i vitalik have an account		
that's 0x eight blah blah blah blah and it's 20 bytes		
well instead we can say well i have an account that is		
number one eight seven four two two four in the tree		
right and that goes down from 20 bytes to just like an index and a position		
which is three bytes right so you use all sorts of these fancy compression		
tracks then you basically just instead of publishing all these		
transactions you publish this like tiny compressed blob		
right so the amount of data that goes on chain goes down by maybe about a factor		
of ten right and then the second thing is that		
you don't do the computation on chin instead you do the computation off-chain		
and there's one of two ways to do this right		
one is called a zk roll up which is you just provide a zika snark that		
basically says hey look i did this computation and uh and i have		
this proof that here's the here's the you know some hash of the		
result and it's correct and then you stick it on chain		
and everyone verifies this one proof instead of verifying all these		
transactions and then the other approach is called an		
optimistic roll-up which is basically made of the scheme where like first		
someone says like hey this is what i think the result of the		
of applying these transactions is and then someone else can say i disagree the		
result is different and only if two people disagree do you		
actually do it on like do you actually just like publish all of		
the data and run the whole that whole blog on chain so if there's		
disagreements then you just like run everything on chain and whoever		
was wrong like loses a lot of money right so disagreements are very rare and		
they're very expensive and in a ck roll up you don't even rely		
on this like challenging game at all you just rely on a proof so		
you know the core principle is basically that		
instead of lots of transactions and all the trends that everyone verifies every		
transaction it is you take the transactions you		
strip strip them down and compress them as much as possible		
then stick that on the blockchain you do need to stick something on the		blockchain
blockchain just so that everyone everyone else can like keep keep up to		blockchain
date with the states so they know you know what all the contracts are what		
all the balances are and all of this but it's a very small amount of data and		
then you use some one of these other off-chain games you know could be this		
optimistic game could be a zk-snark to just prove that		
somebody out there did the compensation and the result is correct		
right so you're pushing like 90 of the work off chain and then		
you know well 90 of the data ends 99 of the computation option		
and then you still have 10 of the data and 1 of the computation on chin		
and so you know your scalability goes up by a factor of about a hundred		
so these systems are already alive for for some applications right so there's		
something called loopering which is just a		
zk roll up for payments right so you can have		
you know assets inside of us inside of the loopering system		
and you can go around and transfer them but		
uh what you um and you get like much lower transaction fees		
right like instead of five dollars you'd have to pay like less than five cents		
um but the only problem is that this only supports a couple of applications		
right now like making one that supports anything that you can do on		
ethereum just takes a bit more work but that's being done as well right so like		ethereum
within a few months i'm expecting you know fully ethereum um capable		ethereum
um roll ups to um be available as well so then so roll ups just summarizing you		
know do most of the work off chain put only a little bit on chain		
factor of 100 scaling sharding another factor of 100 scaling 100 times 100		
factor of 10 000 you know hundreds of thousands of		
transactions a second and like you know there's your scalability		
okay so you choose scalability you can do a large number of transactions very		
quickly and uh the cost of doing those transactions much lower		
you wrote that uh in the long term zka roll-ups are going to win		
in terms of layer 2 technology specifically you wrote		
in general my own view is that the in the short term optimistic roll ups as		
you were saying are likely to win out of general purpose		
evm computation and zk roll ups are likely to win		
out for simple payments uh exchange in other application specific use cases		
just as you were saying but in the medium to long term zk roll ups will win		
out in all use cases as zk snark technology improves		
why do you think uh zk roll ups are going to win		
the big picture battle over layer 2 technologies		
so i think zk roll ups like once you accept that the technology works are		
just like conceptually simpler and they have nicer properties		
the reason is that they do not have this concept of a challenge game right like		
as i mentioned in an optimistic roll-up the way that		
you ensure that the results are correct is that you let		
one person submit and like they just submit with no proof they just say		
here's what i think the result is and then if someone else disagrees they		
make their own submission and then if you have two disagreeing submissions		
then you actually publish it on chain and you see who's right		
but for this to work like you need to actually wait for someone to disagree		
right so like for example if i have an asset inside of an optimistic roll-up		
and i wants to withdraw it then i actually have to wait a week to withdraw		
it because like if the uh a block that contains my		
withdrawal turns out to be invalid then there needs to be space for someone to		
disagree with it right whereas with a ck roll up like you		
don't need time for disagreement because you just have a proof right as soon as		
the block is submitted there's a proof and you know it's correct so		
disagreements especially in the long term or sparse uh		
then uh then then you don't want to do the		
optimistic the the game theoretic thing you know		
you want to do the zk stock right the z case		
stuff is just like you can in a ck roll up you can withdraw immediately		
um you don't have to like worry about the economics of proving as much		
there's just like fewer issues um the reason why ck roll-ups are not winning		
everywhere today is because you know zeke's darks is still a crazy new		
technology right like this is something that		
10 years ago you know it existed only in theory and there was none in practice		
um then you know eight years ago people were just getting excited about it in		
bitcoin conferences for the first time um like four years starting four years		bitcoin
ago or three and a half years ago even that		
was the first time you were able to make any zika snark based anything on		
ethereum and then people started making them and		ethereum
zk technology has only really become efficient enough to do a lot of things		
within the past maybe one and a half years so it's		
it's new technology it's crazy technology it's admittedly scary		
technology if you want to learn more i also have an		
article about this on vitality.ca it's actually really really good		
most of your writing uh it's it goes it's		
technical but it's accessible i highly highly recommend		
to check out vitalik's articles and blogs whatever whatever you call them		
yeah it's brilliant summary of the work actually uh ethereum documentation		ethereum
period is really good i think that's somewhat crowdsourced that documentation		
is really really accessible and brilliant		
uh but let me ask about sort of other approaches to layer two		
like side chains so the one popular one is polygon		
what are your thoughts about polygon which is a layer two		
network is it positive is it negative for ethereum is it both does it have a		ethereum
future which is its own chain but it's using		
a theory it's like based on ethereum essentially		ethereum
or maybe you can describe what it is um so i think there is a really big and		
important difference in security models between roll-ups and side-chains		
which is basically that roll-ups inherit from the security of ethereum right so		ethereum
like if i have coins inside of bloopering or		
optimism or arbitrarium um or zk sync um then even if everyone else in the		
world who is participating in these ecosystems so like hates me and though		
and wants to steal my money i can still personally		
make sure that you know no matter what happens i get them i get my money out		
it might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out and i have to do		
transactions like on the main chain but i'll be able to do it whereas in polygon		
which is a side chain and so instead of being secured by		
ethereum it's also in part secured by its own		ethereum
um a proof of state consensus with its own token so		token
if 70 of the whole or even 51 of the holders of polygon tokens wanted		
to take my money in polygon they can right so that's the pro		
and like to be fair like there aren't even like the		
the supply i don't think is even that widely distributed right so like		
potentially you could you could this idea 51		
of the token holders coming together and stealing everything like it's		token
it's not impossible right uh where does the scaling of polygon come from like		
why is it able to process much more transactions		
than the ethereum main chain what's the idea		ethereum
there i think in part like i imagine i'm not sure		
exactly what its capacity level is but like i imagine it has a higher capacity		
because it's a bit more willing to take		
centralization trade-offs and then another thing is that like if		
the ethereum ecosystem like even if it did not do that right if		ethereum
you think about an ethereum ecosystem hypothetically scaling with side chains		ethereum
then you know you would have 100 copies of		
polygon and you know they would each have their own tokens they would each		
have their own chins and so even if each one of those chains		
was only as scalable as ethereum you know you know you could still like		ethereum
the total sum of them would still be 100 times more than ethereum		ethereum
okay um the now the thing that i want to say in polygons favor just to be very		
fair to them like i i i really you know i i definitely really you know respect		
the work that they're doing so you know start with the um		
a bit with that word of uh not criticism caution right like it's		
um that they made this kind of deliberate trade-off for very		
pragmatic reasons which is that the ethereum ecosystem needs to scale		ethereum
now and there are applications that want to do something now		
and you know if there aren't ethereum friendly options for them then		ethereum
like they're not going to just wait peacefully and do nothing for 12 months		
you know they're going to go to you know either binance smart chain or		
you know one of some other system or potentially		
something that just has totally no alignment with ethereum		ethereum
values whatsoever um but whereas you know with paul with		
polygon like the best thing that you can say in		
polygons favor and against optimism is that you know optimism is not live and		
polygonal is life right like it just takes more work to		
create a system that has these extra roll-ups uh security		
features and so polygon just said we're gonna be		
the system that makes the pragmatic tradeoff we're gonna go		
you know functionality first and then you know we can talk about adding back		
the security later so i've talked to them and like in		
principle i think they're very you know open to the idea		
of like adding more more security and at least becoming more		
uh becoming a roll up or at least you know		
adding a polygon chain let's say roll up at		
some point in the future which is definitely something i think		
they yeah you know absolutely should follow through one		
but like the fact that like they exist now and so you know applications can		
kind of bootstrap now on a chain that you know even though		
it's security isn't perfect at least it exists and people can go use it um and		
then over time you know the chain matures as		
the applications mature like units i think of a very reasonable strategy		
and i'm definitely really happy that they're part of the		
ecosystem yeah it's kind of interesting the		
history of cryptocurrency has this um tension of really good ideas		cryptocurrency
that are hard to implement so they take longer to implement		
and ideas that are not as good but are faster to implement this is like the		
story of like you have like javascript that basically		
took over the world because it was quick to implement within		
10 days and then like later kept fixing itself		
i i don't know what to make of that sort of from an engineering perspective		
i'm more and more becoming comfortable and accepting the fact that our whole		
world will run a technology that's not as good as it could have been		
just because the crappy solution is faster to implement and it sticks		
what do you make of that tension i think the		
compromise that we've been taking within ethereum is		ethereum
like when we have to take the crappy solution we look for crappy solutions		
that are forward compatible with becoming good over time		
right like when you build the the quick and dirty thing like you		
you would still already have ideas in your head about		
you know what the the more complete thing with all the security features		
added on would look like right even if it requires a hard fork		
um yes like even so you know like for example we're sharding right like well		
yeah i think it's likely that the first version of		
chardonnay that comes out like is not going to have you know zk snarks and		
data availability sampling for example but we know what these technologies are		
we feel like we you know have wrapped our heads around		
them and so we know how to build a system		
where we can put all the pieces in place so that it becomes very easy to bolt		
those components on in the future uh so like if you do things that way		
right then at the beginning you can have your		
system that has the functionality but say has less security or like less		
sustainability or less of something else but then over time like it's designed in		
such a way that it has this easy on on-ramp to adding those things		
right and if you don't think explicitly about like being future compatible then		
you do often end up with a a quick and dirty solution that backs you into a		
corner and then there are definitely cases		
where like i think the ethereum ecosystem has suffered from that and we		ethereum
have had to like expand pretty significant effort		
on for example removing features that we didn't realize		
that we actually can't sustain like one big example is just increasing the yeah		
the gas costs so like making some operations more expensive when they uh		
because they should be expensive because they actually take a lot of time in the		
process and um so that's you know making a thing		
some things more expensive kind of like taking some functionality away		
um so if you can like be cognizant of where		
you're likely going into the future and if you don't know like even be cognizant		
of both the most likely paths that you'll take in the future		
and coming like thinking about your road map and coming up with a road map where		
you know that like if you wants to do either of those things then you have a		
clean path toward it that's probably the best kind of		
practical way to get the best of both worlds that we have		
okay let's talk about this uh wonderful process of		
merging okay so there's the main net		
which is the ethereum 1.0 chain or the ch		ethereum
what should we say the chain that uses proof of work as a consensus mechanism		
and then there is uh what is it called the the beacon chain		
that uses the uh the proof of stake mechanism and i believe		
the beacon has been deployed successfully is		
is working so that was in december 2020 there's a		
bunch of questions around that that's fascinating as well but		
i think the most fascinating question is um		
it's about merging those two when do the two chains one that's proof of work		
one that's proof of stake merge and what are the most difficult		
parts of this process right so i guess you've said right the way that we if i		
set up this proof of stake transition is that at first		
the proof of stake chain just launches on its own right and this is the thing		
that happened in december and the proof of stake chain		
has been running for close to six months uh		
now um i mean by the time people watch this it might actually be six months		
um and but it isn't actually coming to consensus on anything except for itself		
right so the idea behind that is to just give		
the proof of stake chain time to mature time for people to build the		
ecosystem around it time to make sure that there aren't any bugs		
um and just like prove to the community that you know proof of stake actually is		
real and it's and a full transition is realistic		
because you know the thing that you're transitioning to		
already exists and already works and then at some point in the future		
you have this event called the merge where you basically		
take the activity that's being done inside of the proof of work chain		
and you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain so you get rid of		
the proof of work side completely uh so the way that the merge		
will work is um and it's definitely gone through a few different iterations like		
the the earlier versions of this actually required more work for users		
and more work for clients it was much more like		
oh there's this new chain there's this old chain and then		
everyone has to like migrate from the old chain to the new chain and then at		
some point we'll forget about the old chin		
the new version is designed to be much more seamless for users right so		
basically what actually happens is that the old chain basically becomes		
embedded inside the new chain right so at		
starting from the merge transition block every proof of stake chain block is		
going to contain a block of the what what we consider now to what we		
consider to be the ethereum chain today but we'll call it the execution chain		ethereum
and then at the same time to create one of these blocks you're not		
going to need proof of work anymore right so basically at the same time you		
would both get rid of the proof of work requirements for one of these blocks to		
be valid but instead you require these blocks to		
be embedded inside of the proof of stake blocks right so		
you basically have like a chain inside a chain		
and this is you know from an architecture perspective it's you know		
you might think it's a little bit sub-optimal but it actually has some		
nice properties and makes it easier to kind of think about the		
consensus and think about the what we call the execution layer		
like transactions and contracts kind of separately		
and upgrade them separately um and it also just means that the upgrade		
process is extremely seamless right because		
from the point of view of a client that's following the chain you basically		
have to up update nothing right you're still		
following the same chain and follows the same		
rules except instead of checking proof of work you'll switch to		
checking that these blocks are embedded inside of blocks of the proof statute		
so there'll be this merge block that will mark this transition		
and over time i guess the the new chain will contain the full		
record of all the transactions that's ever happened on the previous chain		
on the old chain so like maybe i'm asking a dumb question here but		
in in this process is the new chain going to have		
all the information of the past transactions		
the new chain is not going to hold information from what happened in the		
ethereum chain before the merge right so like ethereum clients of the um		ethereum
that um people are going to use like around the time of the merchants soon		
after the merge they're probably just going to sync you		
know like and check the proof of work chain		
up to the merge and then they're going to check the proof of stake chain but at		
some point in the future i think people will just stop bothering checking the		
proof of work before the merge got it so that old history information		
is not important for the future or like if you're		
operating actively on the on the new chain that history is not		
important to you it's not impo let's see so it's not		
strictly important for um app for just like in any		
like smart contract or just like applications that run on the blockchain		blockchain
it can be important to users and it can be important for some applications		
but we're basically saying that like maintaining and serving that		
is not going to be simultaneously the responsibility of every ethereum node		ethereum
if you want that information there can be separate protocols for backing it up		
and like these other protocols actually exist right like there's something		
called the graph which is doing some history retrieval		
potentially you can just take that entire chain and stick it on bit torrent		
like there's lots of ways to like archive it		
and create kind of customized search protocols for it		
so what's your sense why so there's a python 2 in python 3 and it took 4		
ever for people to switch what's your sense why this		
merge has been taking longer than perhaps was expected		
i think the biggest reason is just you know we've been		
underestimating the technical complexity there's a lot of technical complexity in		
making a successful proof of stake chain there's a lot of technical complexity in		
actually figuring out the transition process		
there's so that's bigger than social complexity so it's uh the technical		
complexity you would say is the bigger reason for the		
any delays than the social complexity i i actually think so i and i		
i think we've been very fortunate to not have too much social complexity around		
the merge so not much drama no um i think the		
the biggest part of the reason is just because we have been talking about proof		
of stake in charting as being part of the road map since um		
almost the very beginning of the project right like the very first proof-of-stake		
blog post does from january 2014 which was you know um		
two months after the project started and like maybe even a day after the		
announcement um so you know it was proof of stake was		
not something that we uh kind of put on any on anybody by surprise		
and then when the dow fork happened and you know the people on the edc side		
split off i think it also just happens that a lot		
of the people that were not willing to stomach the dow fork and then join the		
etc side they were the more bitcoiny types and		
the more bitcoiny types do also tends to like like proof of work more		
and so like that also sort of ended up you know sort of		
like purifying the communities on both sides i guess		
so ethereum classic is not switching to proof of stake and		ethereum
you know they're happy with their setup and		
by the time that uh you know it came through the beacon chain launching ends		
and now i think the community is there's very strongly in favor of the		
proof of stake switch but let me ask the question that no		
engineer wants to hear which is uh the question of timeline when do you think		
the merge will happen do you have a sense it might		
happen this year dear sense it might be pushed towards		
next year 2022 um or uh or even beyond		
um i think early 2022 was like the most realistic		
there's i think there's definitely still like an optimistic case of it happening		
this year but like the realistic thing to count on is		
definitely the early part of very early part of next year is there		
specific things that stand out to you that are		
like do they'll make you feel good about progress		
if you see it happening um so the thing that we		
had last month is that we had this online hackathon called rayonism where		
basically a bunch of uh the different uh client developers that		
are going to be part of the transition like hacks together some test nets of		
the post-merge ethereum chain so these were only test nets of what		ethereum
would happen after the merge they were not test nets of the transition itself		
so the thing that people are working on now actually is the transition		
um so having a full specification of both the		
transition and post transition i mean we have specifications now but		
like in a realistic way though probably needs to have a couple		
of changes and have things that continue to be ironed out		
and then have a yet test net that does both the transition		
and the post transition and then like once you have a test network then		
you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it um and then		
you know do some runs on not just a specialized test network but on say an		
existing test network like a rob center rinkeby that		
ethereum people already significantly use and if it works then		ethereum
you can deploy the transition on mainnet just as a quick comment		
because this is fascinating in august of last year		
there was this uh medalla i believe it's pronounced madasha it's a		
south american subway station i forget where but spell		
with two l's yeah yeah because that's you know that's		
how spanish works right like the two else have uh		
dasha yeah okay cool anyway but i read about it		
in uh middle of august august 14th there was an incident		
on that test net um what how does this process work like what do you learn from		
those kinds of incidents when stuff goes wrong		
in the test process um i think uh that incidence was that		
there was a consensus failure of some kindness i remember um		
basically just different clients interpreting things in different ways		
and then one of them getting kicked off the network		
and then it ended up taking a while to actually like		
get everyone to get back online like a big part of the reason why it took weeks		
to resolve right is because it's on a test network like the coins		
are valueless and so there's not really this big push of any kind for		
people to actually you know going down with a new client so		
they can start participating again and so you know it definitely took a		
while until the chain started finalizing again um		
but and then also like there was i think another		
round of just not finalizing in october as i remember		
um that i mean there were definitely things that we learned like there were		
a lot of things especially that client developers just learned about like		
optimization and how to build their clients in a way		
that they can process things efficiently um there's a lot that we		
learned from just like seeing the full life cycle of what happens when		
more than a third of the validators go offline and then finalization stops		
and then that kind of weird unusual state of the chain		
continues for a while and then eventually everyone who is not		
participating just gets enough of their stake like we don't		
use the word swash we use the word weak for this but like basically also burned		
um until you know the people who are participating go back up to two thirds		
and then the chain goes back to finalizing		
so just seeing all of those edge cases play out live i think actually helped a		
lot and probably helped to really contribute to		
making us feel better about midnight i mean there's also an incident		
just recently in april 24th of 2021 where uh		
this was on beacon i guess there was a bug discovered in the software client		
prism that prevented roughly 70 percent of		
validators on the network from producing blocks i mean maybe you		
can comment on what happened but broadly like the big picture what kind		
of stuff are you worried about in terms of		
problems that might arise we're talking about small bugs i were		
talking about like emergent social unexpected		
social bugs you know what are the things that worry about the future of ethereum		ethereum
that you want to make sure you construct		
mechanisms that prevent those things from happening		
so one of the lucky things there was that this particular bug only prevented		
proposals of blocks it did not prevent attestations		
right so at the stations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks		
and it's the attestations that are actually responsible for the chain		
finalizing so like coming to this more permanent agreement on blocks right		
so the chain was actually quite stable all the way through		
um the i think the thing that we generally		
learned from these experience experiences		
is just how valuable it is to have the some multi-client network		
right so this is one of these areas where i think ethereum distinguishes		ethereum
itself from like bitcoin for example right that in ethereum we don't have		ethereum, bitcoin
one single client that that everyone um just runs right there's multiple		
implementations of the protocol and these multiple		protocol
implementations they're they all process and verify the blocks that each		
other can you know verify right so they all speak		
the same language now sometimes when there's a bug they		
disagree right and when two clients disagree because of a		
bug we call this a consensus failure and consensus failures are pretty		
serious right and when you have um clients monoculture like		
bitcoin does then like it's more rare to have		bitcoin
consensus failures do you still have them actually bitcoin had a consensus		bitcoin
failure between two different versions of the same client back in 2013		
um but they're less likely to happen but the interesting thing is that the		
multi-client architecture has actually i think saved ethereum much more than		ethereum
it's heard it so even in this most recent incidents		
right like prism was not producing blocks but all the other clients were		
still producing blocks um there's four others right yes it's a		
prism nimbus teku and the white house um		
and then also ethereum back in 2016 had this fun		ethereum
event that we call the shanghai dos attacks uh they're called that because		
uh the attacks started like right on the		
first day of a of our annual conference at defcon that		
happens to be in shanghai that year so what happened like basically was that		
someone came up with a way to create blocks		
that were very slow for one clients to process but not the other client		
so at that time there were basically two ethereum clients there were they were		ethereum
called geth and parity um right now i think the top three ones		
are gath nethermind and baso um but		
what happened as a result of us having two clients is that the attacker was		
just not able to come up with blocks that		
both clients were like uh completely failing at processing		
and so like a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants they just		
kept on switching between the two implementations		
depending on which one worked and that actually really helped the		
the chain i kind of survived through that month of attacks as the attacker		
just like kept on hammering at our system and identifying		
all of the weaknesses and just like forcing our clients to do		
this you know rapid sprint of just like optimizing the		
hell out of everything and make sure there aren't any of those uh dust blocks		
or uh and dust bugs remaining um so that was		
another example and then like as a counterpoint as a		
counter example so like something that also shows the point		
from the other side um bitcoin had this bug in 2010 right		bitcoin
the balance overflow bug basically someone		
created a transaction that had two outputs and those		
outputs had were both of a few billion bitcoin so like about two to the power		bitcoin
of 63 satoshis and then if you add those numbers		
together you you go above to the power of 64.		
and of course you know computers like once you go above to the power of 64 you		
wrap around and so the bitcoin nodes thought that		bitcoin
there was enough money to pay for the transaction because it was asking for		
let's say like a billion satoshis or something but actually it was asking for		
to the power of 64 plus a billion and so you know the attacker just managed to		
create like billions of bitcoin out of thin air and		bitcoin
this was not only discovered and fixed after something like 12 hours		
um but you know if there had been like if bitcoin had been a multiple		bitcoin
implementation system then what would have almost certainly		
happened is like one of the clients would have		
bugged out but the other clients would have		
probably you know actually had a check for that right and so		
there would have been a consensus failure but at least that would have		
um like alerted everyone that there is a problem very		
quickly and it also would have given everyone just like obvious social		
permission to go and you know pick which whichever one of the		
chains is correct and solve the problem um so like that's		
i think a big learning that we've had from multiple		
of our experiences in the ethereum ecosystem just like		ethereum
validating this multi-client model you know to be fair it's a model that we get		
criticized for a lot right like bitcoin people talk about you know the		bitcoin
risk of consensus failures that this creates		
um vc types are like well you know isn't it expensive and wasteful to funds three		
software teams where you could just be making you know one		
quote focused effort you know they love the word focused and like you know		
ethereum is not that but it's amazing despite not being that		ethereum
yeah um the basically yes so that was interesting		
and and then you know there have definitely been other		
learnings as well just from like seeing the chain live and		
you know seeing what actually is the staking experience		staking
like what are the actual incentives for all the different participants um		
so i definitely feel like we're gaining a lot from this sort of one year of uh		
trial running the chain before we actually make all of ethereum depend on		ethereum
it let me ask uh perhaps a strange question		
but uh you know proponents of bitcoin will say		bitcoin
uh things like bitcoin fixes everything so why do we need ethereum		ethereum, bitcoin
uh versus like bitcoin plus lightning network for scalability		bitcoin
uh and then using bitcoin for with this proof of work for security so		bitcoin
in this kind of um it is perhaps sort of a strange question		
but it's a high-level question why do we need another technology		
yes there's a bunch of nice features but like		
doesn't bitcoin fix everything already so		bitcoin
and the thing that always attracted me about		
bitcoin is you know these values of you know decentralization creating these		bitcoin
open provisional systems that anyone can participate in		
and that aren't just going to flop over and die if whoever created them gets		
bored and like no that are resistance to like whoever runs		
them breaking the rules and all of these things right and		
i think that pretty strongly that these principles are		
like really valid in importance to much more things than just money right like		
bitcoin is uh the blockchain for money and ethereum		blockchain, ethereum, bitcoin
is uh built from the start as a general		
purpose blockchain right it's you know there is ether the asset on ethereum but		blockchain, ethereum
then you can also make you know decentralized financial things		decentralized
what we call d5 today um you know you can make like ens the		
decentralized domain name system um you can put make prediction markets		decentralized
on it you can make totally non-financial		
systems that just like keep track of whether or not		
some certificate was signed or whether or not some like cryptographic key got		cryptographic
revoked there's this big long list of like just		
interesting things that you could use about blockchains to do		
right like basically they are sort of the missing piece		
that um where without them the kinds of things that a decentralized computer		decentralized
network can do is very limited and once you have them you know a lot of		
those limitations end up going away uh and so		
ethereum was like always from the beginning about that right it's about		ethereum
like hey this isn't just money this is there's so		
much more that you could do if you could just go ahead and make any		
infrastructure or you know digital institution or dao		dao
or whatever you want to call it where you the kind of the base layer of		
the logic is just executed in this open and transparent way where everyone can		
see what's going on or you know if you like your zero knowledge proofs at least		
everyone can see proofs that prove to you that		
what's going on follows the rules um and you don't need to		
like just constantly keep trusting centralized actors		
and hence the smart contracts exactly as being a sort of a core technology as		
part of ethereum yes exactly smart contracts the computer		ethereum
programs that are running on ethereum they are like the core of what makes		ethereum
ethereum general purpose yeah um so i think like i do think that		ethereum
you know there's a lot more that wrong with the world than		
just money right like i'm not one of these people who thinks that		
you know if you get rid of fiat currency and you replace it with cryptocurrency		cryptocurrency
then suddenly wars are going to go away right because		
like first of all um you know like senoraj revenue is only a small portion		
of government revenue right it's like what		
five ten percent something like that second of all like if		
you are the sort of um this is one of the things i don't even get about their		
philosophy like let's say you're the sort of person who		
is a like an extreme and very distrusting libertarian and you think		
that these governments are terrible right like we we know today that		
governments find a combination of you know things like welfare and things		
like you know the military that you know goes and like bombs people in		
afghanistan right and the so the question you have to ask is		
like okay you um with your new um you know		
magic newfangled cyber currency that takes over the world		
take away the government's ability to have seniors revenue and so you reduce		
the government's revenue by 10 if the government is that evil which		
portion of its um expenses is it going to take that 10		
from is it gonna stop the bombing people in afghanistan or is it going to cut		
welfare if you think it's the first you have a		
very optimistic view of the government right so that's		
i guess my perspective on like why the whole um you know		
we're going to save the world and create and		
uh create peace by like denying governments the right to stealth		
taxation kind of perspective doesn't really make much sense for me		
and i do think that there is real value that comes from a		
decentralized and open currency like just the fact that there is a financial		decentralized
infrastructure that anyone in the world can		
you know go ahead and use right like it's		
and that's something that can easily be a big boon for people right there's a		
lot of places where the uh currency and		
is much less stable than the dollar and you know these people like they don't		
like well if they use bitcoin their only option is to get big ones		bitcoin
right which you know are also pretty volatile		
um if they use ethereum then you know they can get ether but then they can		ethereum
also get stable coins right and you might think that you know oh		
you're not being ideologically pure now you're giving them stable coins		
which are mirroring dollars and obviously dollars are going to collapse		
too but the reality is that delvers are		
vastly more stable than the venezuelan bolivar		
so like there are really like meaningful and beneficial		
things that you can give to people by create having a global		
and open financial system but i think if you want to actually do		
that like you have to have much more than just a currency right		
and then if you want to go beyond financial things then you know you have		
to obviously have much more than a currency		
and then you know you also have to actually		
actually take scalability seriously because the non-financial applications		
like nobody's going to pay five dollars a transaction for them		
can we return to dogs sure no no no no no no no no the other one's		
categorically forbidden get categorical is there any cryptocurrency based on		cryptocurrency
cats actually i i think there are like was		
there was cat coin there was neon coin for some reason they just didn't catch		
on as much as the dog coins did okay so let's talk		
about dogecoin and elon musk elon said that quote ideally		
doge speeds up block time 10x increases block size 10x and drops		
fee 100x then it wins hands down end quote you said		
in the blog post partially responding to that		
that there are subtle technical reasons why this is not possible		
to this elon said that you quote fear the doge uh so let's talk about		
this what are the technical uh hurdles for		
dogecoin that prevent it from becoming one of the primary		
cryptocurrencies of the world and do you in fact		
fear the doge i definitely feel obligated to correct the record i		
definitely do not fear the dosh okay no i love the		
dosh um i actually visited the doge in japan a few years		
back it's uh she's an amazing dog he's still alive		
wait the original doge yeah oh wow um		
so you know we accept doge every every year for our annual def con		
conferences um so and i definitely you know don't		
think ethereum is opposed to dot coins i mean		ethereum
like i kind of wants to feel like you know ethereum is at least a little bit		ethereum
in spirit itself a dog coin and then you know as i'm as i mentioned you know i		
love doge i bought i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold		
some a bunch of dosh the on the scalability question like the		
challenge basically is like the limits uh scalability as a and the		
trade-offs with centralization right like if you just		
increase the parameters without doing anything else then it just becomes		
more and more difficult for people to validate the chain and uh		
just becomes more likely that the chain becomes centralized and		
becomes vulnerable to all kinds of capture so does it need like		
some of the layer two technologies that we've been talking about		
um i mean i personally think that you know if doge wants to		
somehow bridge to ethereum and then people can trade doge thousands of times		ethereum
a second inside of loopering then you know that would be		
amazing i mean if they want to just like take zika roll up style technology and		
just have thousands of transactions a second on their own chain then that's um		
you know that would be a great outcome as well so what is there ways for		
ethereum and uh dogecoin to work together so		ethereum
okay so there's a power behind a person like elon musk pushing the development		
of a cryptocurrency is there ways to leverage that power and		cryptocurrency
that momentum to improve ethereum to improve some of		ethereum
the sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are		
already technologically advanced and pushing forward that kind of technology		
i i definitely think there is room for you know that uh there's that meme		
of doge like taking over that's the door i've seen it		
is there a way to ride that uh that storm that wave of the doge		
has taken over i think if we could have a secure doshu ethereum bridge then		ethereum
you know that would be amazing and then when ethereum gets its scalability		ethereum
any scalability thing that works for ethereum assets you would be able to		ethereum
also like trade wrapped doors with extremely low		
transaction fees and very high speed as well		
is there uh is there precedence for building secure bridges between		
cryptocurrencies is that i mean how difficult is this		
kind of task that's it's definitely something that's in its infancy infancy		
there definitely have been some cross-chain interaction things that have		
been done before um so one the earliest is probably the		
concept of merge mining right when a chain just makes its entire		mining
proof-of-work algorithm dependent on the proof-of-work algorithm of another		
chain and so i think famous doshcoin actually merged mines		
the litecoin which is i think in retrospect it's not looking		
like a very good choice because now deutsche coin is bigger than litecoin um		
but um you know if there's potentially some		
way for dogecoin to merge mine within ethereum		ethereum
proof of stake ins of some kinds then like that could be an interesting		
alternative um if so that's one type of like chain		
interaction as far as like bridges like one chain		
reading another chain early in ethereum's history there was		ethereum
this project called btc relay it's a smart contract on ethereum that		ethereum
just verifies bitcoin blocks i think people stopped really caring		bitcoin
about and maintaining it because there just weren't enough		
applications that were actually interested in using it at the time and		
the transaction fees got too high to actually maintain it		
so i i think if we want to make a btc relay 2.0		
and that becomes cheaper because you know it uses snarks or something like		
that then you probably could but and maybe now is the time when you		
actually like can do that sort of one-way		
verification but the one challenge though is that		
if he wants to have a bridge that allows you to move assets between chins		
then you don't just need one-way verification you need two-way		
verification right and ethereum can verify anything		ethereum
because ethereum smart contracts can just run arbitrary code		ethereum
but if you want bitcoin to be able to do things based on what happens in ethereum		ethereum, bitcoin
lands then like bitcoin would have to basically		bitcoin
well they can do everything with soft forks because like you know that that's		
their religion but no they'll they'll do it that way		
and if doge wants to make a fork where that allow allows for		
like two-way transferability with the		
ethereum then you know they could i mean i i think that would		ethereum
be a lovely collaboration to make if there's interest i think there might		
actually even be some multi-sig funds that have some um		
some funding it's just a bounty for someone to make a bridge between the two		
yeah could you maybe try to psychoanalyze elon musk for a brief		
second so what are your thoughts about tesla		
and elon musk's journey through the cryptocurrency world		cryptocurrency
so first with bitcoin and then with doshcoin		bitcoin
so acquiring a large acquiring holding a large amount of bitcoin		bitcoin
and i believe at least considering the acquiring and holding a large amount of		
doshcoin positives negatives what do you think the future		
for tesla and spacex in the cryptocurrency space looks like		cryptocurrency
do you think they'll consider ethereum um i'm i'm sure that if you know that		ethereum
they stay in the the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all		cryptocurrency
then they have to at some point yeah you know bitcoin number one		bitcoin
dogecoin number i mean you know come on it deserves to be number three		
and then or number two and then ethereum can be whatever that uh		ethereum
whatever that other number is um but um the if ethereum only becomes a dot		ethereum
coin somehow maybe change the logo to incorporate		
a dog of some sort almost like doors like		
uh sneaking behind oh that would be that would be fascinating before the emerge		
happened and i think like elon you definitely		
i think you would make a mistake if you were to kind of		
ascribe too much like sophisticated malevolent ins or or		
any intel like deep intentionality to the whole process		
i think like he's just a human being and he likes dogs just like i like dogs yeah		
right that is i think that is literally the		
reasoning behind the whole dose dogecoin thing		
there is some aspect to which i mean the guy		
helped launch a car into space right like you could you could ask like		
what is the purpose of that i think the purpose of that is uh fun		
there i think he truly is more and more especially		
lately embodying the whole idea that the most		
the most entertaining outcome is the most likely and he's fully embracing the		
most entertaining outcome and in many ways dogecoin is the most		
entertaining cryptocurrency as cryptocurrency becomes more and more		cryptocurrency
impactful in the world people are getting more and more serious		
about it and so he's selecting the cryptocurrency that is the most the		cryptocurrency
least serious and the most fun and there's something to that uh like		
coupling fun with uh technological sophistication		
um and somehow figuring out a way to do that absolutely you do that well you		
know i i i want the world to be fun i think the		
world being fun is great okay let me ask about a couple other		
technologies if it's okay sure what are your thoughts about chain		
link and hybrid smart contracts that utilize off-chain external data sources		
and i think it's definitely necessary for smart contracts so that		
you do a lot of things to use off chain data of some kind right like		
if you want to have a stable coin you need a price oracle so you know what		
price you're targeting um if he wants to have some fancy you		
know crop insurance gadget like i always you know		
i think ether risk has been doing a lot of uh good work with that in		
i think it was either kenya or sri lanka or both like they're they're making a		
lot of good progress and some in some of those		
places like you need some kind of oracle to		
tell you you know did it actually rain in this particular area		
um if he wants to have like assets that mirror other financial assets you need		
an oracle if you want to have a prediction market		
you need an oracle and so projects that provide oracles are		
definitely really important and there are definitely different kinds of use		
cases like augur is more about you know events		
and the auger oracle is designed like i think differently from chain link right		
like chain link emphasizes the whole you know like we		
have a fast automated thing that just like gives you data		
quickly um whereas auger is more you know we don't give a crap		
about speed um and look we don't need to give a crap		
about speed because if you want to get your money out on a prediction market		
that where in reality it's resolved you can		
probably just sell your coins for 99 cents anyway		
um so i mean i i think i mean the chain link is definitely like		
taking a yeah good and the important part of the oracle design space and i'm		
definitely happy that there is like that project taking the task on and at		
the same time i do think that you know their their frog army on		
twitter can get a bit intense sometimes but like frog		
army is there is there a way to incorporate sort of oracle network type		
of ideas into ethereum i personally		ethereum
would prefer the ethereum base layer like		ethereum
stay away from trying to provide too much functionality because		
i think once you have the ethereum base layer		ethereum
making a claim about like say the us dollar to ethereum price like and		ethereum
at some sense you're basically saying that like ethereum as a		ethereum
base platform starts making what could be geopolitical statements		
right right like for example you know imagine if there was some		
you know civil war in the us split up and you had two currencies that both		
claims to be the us dollar well you know ethereum would would have to		ethereum
pick one for the sake of everyone who's already using that oracle so you know		
does that mean that the blockchain would be		blockchain
like taking a position in this big megapolitical debate		
so i think like for the just those kinds of reasons		
i would personally like prefer um ethereum itself to be more of this sort		ethereum
of pure platform that just analyzes the		
transactions and just mathematically using uh deterministic		
consensus rules and then if you need the oracles that can be all your tears		
i think ethereum benefits from not trying to do everything at layer one		ethereum
and having this like very robust way or two ecosystem where you have all these		
projects doing interesting things yeah focus on the basic technology avoid		
the politics gotcha let me ask a bit of a human question		
charles hoskinson someone you've worked with		
in the early days of ethereum there appears to my outsider view		ethereum
to have been a bit of a falling out is there a positive		
inspiring human story to be told about why you two parted ways		
i kind of wants to let the various books about ethereum speak for themselves		ethereum
um but you know you know if i feel like you know since that time i think you		
know charles has clearly progressed and then he		
matured in a lot of ways and i mean people who follow charles		
closely have definitely told me that you know like 2021 charles is very different		
from 2014 charles and i'm sure 2021 vitalik		
is much different from 2014 metallic as well i'm		
kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and		
charles look like as well oh interesting like the progression of		
the humans is this going to be one of those things		
where like everyone comes full circle and then 2030 vitalik and charles are		
best friends yeah i mean not necessarily best friends		
but some kind of uh um are able to reminisce in ways that		
is um that puts some of the tension of the		
past behind i think such things are possible um i think		
you know people definitely absolutely have a right to		
and uh and they should strive to just constantly change and reinvent		
themselves um is there something you could say		
about your thoughts about the cardano project		
that charles hoskinson leads they've worked on some interesting ideas that		
mirror some of the ideas in ethereum proof of stake		ethereum
working on smart contracts and all those kinds of things		
is there something again positive inspiring that you could say		
are they a competitor is it complementary technology		
it's uh and there's definitely interesting ideas in there i mean i do		
think cardano takes a bit of a different approach than		
ethereum and that you know they really emphasize having these big		ethereum
academic proofs for everything whereas ethereum tends to be more okay with		ethereum
heuristic arguments and in part because it's just trying to do more faster		
um but you know there's definitely very interesting things that come out of		
you know iohk research and so is there can you comment on that kind of idea i		
as sort of uh having a foot in research enjoy		
charles's kind of emphasis on papers and like deep academic rigor is there		
what's the role of deep research rigor in the world of		
cryptocurrency interesting i'm actually the sort of		cryptocurrency
person who thinks deep rigor is overrated		
um the reason why i think deep rigor is overrated is because i think like		
the the in terms of like why protocols fail		
i think the number of failures or that are outside the model is even more		
important is like bigger and more important than		
the failures that are inside the model right so if you take selfish mining for		mining
example like the the that original discovery from 2013		
that showed how um bitcoin does		bitcoin
like even if it has a 50 uh fault tolerance assuming everyone's honest it		
only has a yeah you know zero to 33 percent fault		
tolerance depending on your network model		
if you assume uh rational actors and like to me that wasn't that was a great		
example of like an outside the model failure right because		
traditional consensus research just up until		
or before the blockchain days did not think about		blockchain
like incentivization much right like there was a little bit of thought about		
incentivization there's like a couple of papers on the byzantine		
altruist rational model but it wasn't that deep it was mostly		
operating under the assumption that you know this we're going to make		
consensus between 15 participants and these are institutions		
and if something goes wrong then you know if it was we can figure out		
whether or not it was deliberate offline and if they did something evil we		
consume them whereas in the crypto world you can't do		crypto
that right and so like that whole discovery basically		
arose just because like you know the model of uh		
traditional uh consensus research just like didn't cover those possibilities		
and then like once you go out of the model those		
other issues do exist right um so but then at the same time		
like there definitely are um protocols that		
turn out to be insecu that do have failures inside the		
model like this reminds me of at the time when		
i think i found a bug in a proposed uh consensus implementation from either		
bitshares or eos this happened around the end of 2017. um		
so that was definitely inside the model because like they had		
a very clear idea of what they were trying to achieve they had a very clear		
description and like there's a very clear		
mathematical um argument for why the description doesn't lead to what they're		
trying to achieve but ultimately what you're trying to achieve can never		
be fully like described in formal language right like		
i think this is the big discovery of you know the ai safety people for example		
right like just having a a specification of what		
you want is an insanely hard problem and like the more powerful the optimizer		
that you're giving the instructions to the more you have to be careful		
and and so you know i think there are kind of these two sides		
and then the other thing is that a lot like a lot of the academic		
approach ends up like basically optimizing for other		
people inside of the academic system and it doesn't really optimize for like		
curious outsiders whereas like i personally met like totally optimized		
for curious outsiders or at least i feel like i strive to		
so i guess like that's my case for why i like tends to behave in ways that you		
know occasionally traditional academic types		
criticize as being reckless um but i you know on the other hand you		
know there's i mean there's definitely real benefits		
that come from like just taking us		
a rigorous approach especially when you know you know what the thing that		
ex like you know what the specification is of what you're trying to get		
and like you're trying to kind of improve your way		
or provide protocols that actually provide that like you know exactly what		
you're looking for i feel like realistically		
you probably wants to do both kinds of analysis		
and like sometimes even want to do both kinds of analysis and stages right like		
you have you want to do more quick and dirty		
things and even want public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff		
and then later on you formalize it more and then you get more feedback		
um like in general i guess i feel like the norms of research in		
the future like the internet has just changed so much there's no way that it's		
not going and you know it's it's even changed like		
collaboration structures and like the patterns in which we work with each		
other there's no way that the correct		
structure for club collaborative research is the same		
as what it was 15 years ago but like what combination of these		
existing components and of new ideas it is like that's something that's you know		
totally legitimate to kind of fight it out and i think it's		
great that there's different ecosystems that have different attitudes to things		
like you know i think you know there's a big possibility that		
you know things that the ethereum ways that the ethereum ecosystem		ethereum
approaches some problems is totally wrong and if there's other ecosystems or		
different principles and they can do well that's something that we can		
learn from in the spirit of the depth first search		
can you comment on ai safety and some people are really worried about the		
existential risks of artificial intelligence		
is there something you could say that's uh		
hopeful about how we avoid in the same kind of line of uh reasoning about		
creating formal models versus kind of looking outside the model into		
what the real world actually is like is there some lessons from that we can take		
and map onto the ai safety world where the potentials of the technology whether		
it's in autonomous uh weapon systems or just the paperclip		
problem uh that we can avoid ai destroying the		
world so my impression is actually that like		
this is more of a kind of faraway impression and		
it could be wrong that it might even be that one of the challenges that ai is		
not formal enough like because ai does is very like		
practitioner oriented right like it's all about like hey		
i found a couple of hacks and look i ran them and look you know they seem to		
improve classification accuracy from you know 0.684 to 0.773		
uh so a lot of the time like there just isn't		
actual science behind like why this hack works and why this uh		
other hack doesn't work you just sort of like trial and error your way into it		
um but and i could see how that approach works but at the same time like that		
approach is not good for legibility for example it's		
not good for like understanding what the heck is actually going on		
like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail		
like there's even you know a debate on like can you take gpt3 like things and		
just scale them up and their intelligence will continue to		
improve or is there just like some types of reasoning that they're		
fundamentally bad at and like yeah they're not gonna get good at it no		
matter how much you like scale this exact same approach and add more		
hardware to it so having like		
thinking about what's going on more explicitly i mean my understanding is		
that a big part of a ai safety research is trying to do		
that sort of stuff right and formalize yeah formalize		
try to improve just ai legibility like trying to understand you know if		
the ai makes some classification so we can actually see		
like what happens and what's going on in the middle right		
whereas with crypto or with traditional cryptography		crypto
you know it's like very much not well okay i mean		
i shouldn't quite say that it's traditional cryptography is this		
interesting mix of being very formal and being very informal		
because it's very formal with given these security assumptions prove that		
the protocol works under these security assumptions		protocol
the places where it's very informal is like well how do we even know that there		
isn't an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers		
yeah we kind of tried it for 40 years and then		
you know so far no one's found anything better than the gen general number field		
sieve and like okay fine we'll just assume it's fine		
you know how do we know you can't i'm gonna find uh the the discrete log		
between two elliptic curve points like no did it a couple of decades no one's		
found anything faster than like baby step giant step		
stuff uh so that's and like		
there's there's a there's definitely uh ways in which that approach really makes		
sense right because at least you can concentrate your analysis		
on a small number of building blocks and like you know you do have some intuitive		
reasoning about those building blocks but like at least		
there's a small number of building blocks and lots of people are looking at		
them and then everything else just sort of		
gets formally built on top and you actually can		
like mathematically reduce the security of big thanks to building blocks right		
like you can have mathematical proofs that say		
you know if you make a zk snark of a yes statement when in reality that statement		
is false then you can use that to like		
extract information out of elliptic curves that you know it completely		
breaks the problem or something like that		
uh so so zika is an example where formalism is		
is beneficial absolutely yeah and so maybe you can have the same kind of		
stuff in the ai safety within within ai systems that you can get get a		
hold of some kind of aspect of the systems that you can		
control right provably and then in blockchains and		
cryptocurrency i think the one area where consensus like		cryptocurrency
mechanisms is still more an art than a science		
is that these aren't just like technological systems they're crypto		crypto
economic systems right and they make assumptions about people		
and which assumptions you can make about people is not something that you can		
prove with math right the even just the basic 51 percent		
exact people are honest can you trust the 51 percent		
um if you can't trust the 51 can you trust the other 49		
to be able to coordinate on like making their own fork		
what will happen to coin prices like how do people as		
human beings react to these events like there's all of these assumptions		
yeah but you know at the same time look if you can write down the assumptions		
then you can like do formal things with them i almost forgot		
to ask you about one of the most exciting aspects		
of ethereum i mean it's non-technical i think it's a		ethereum
it's a societal it's social which is nfts so what do you think		
what do you think about the explosion of nfts in the recent		
months especially in the art world and beyond and what does the future look		
like so this is maybe the social impact on the world on on the		
individual creators of all kinds like is that something you've actually		
expected to see and ft's having this kind of impact and		
beyond what do you think will happen in the uh		
in the digital space with nfts in virtual reality and gaming all those		
kinds of things i was definitely surprised by like nfts		
in particular like i even actually i think might be on		
record somewhere on some tech conference panel like they were asking you know		
um it was one of those overrated or underrated sections and asked about nfts		
and i thought and i said like hey i think nfts are		
overrated yeah and you know in retrospect that turned out to be quite		
wrong i might think like i guess i just		
personally can't really relate to this concept of		
like spending a lot of money on a thing like there's nothing you know there's no		
queer kind of understanding of why that thing		
would uh maintain its value right um uniqueness		
of a thing having value right exactly like that's		
like i definitely am like cannot really understand you know the psychology		
behind like buying you know paying two hundred		
thousand dollars for original art painting i'd be like you know		
if i had a mansion just like give me photocopies of everything		
you can hang three photocopies of the the mona lisa section		
well i would even have the mona lisa i think i'd probably just like have some		
nyan cats or something that's one thing where mathematics or		
theoretical computer science cannot formalize why the heck nfts are valuable		
exactly but the thing that uh that		
makes me very happy about the space now that it has happened is that		
i mean this gets back to the conversation that we had at the		
beginning right like i'm interested in this concept of		
decentralized public goods funding right like i want		decentralized
things that are good and valuable to as much as possible also be		
things that can't you know economically sustain the people who produce them		
right because if you don't have that then either the public goods just don't		
get produced at all or people make like centralized versions		
that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes but actually just like		
concentrate control in a very small group right		
and you know both of those things are not very nice uh so		
the nice thing about nfts would be well if you're an artist and you can		
just mint nfts and this is a source of revenue it's like great that's another		
stream of revenue for you know creative work that often does		
still get get underfunded and that's amazing		
okay let me ask you a weird question we talk about craig wright a little bit but		
a lot of people write to me one of two emails		
one email uh is uh calling any coin outside of bitcoin a uh		bitcoin
a scam and then the other email is saying		
my my favorite coin is the best coin it's going to save the world whatever		
that coin is uh and so i sit back and i look at i		
have no idea i i trust i tried to figure out like the		
humans that i trust in this space just but basic human qualities but do		
you think some coins are scams uh		
do you think some coins maybe another way to ask it are scammier than other		
coins how are people that are looking outside		
of the space where there's all these cryptocurrencies supposed to		
figure out what is a scam and not or how to use the		
right kind of language when talking about them		
because there's the harshness of the language from the bitcoin maximalist		bitcoin
that doesn't just say everything is a scam		
including ethereum uh but they use terms like coin		ethereum
that says it's not only a scam it's like a waste of time i mean		
every word you can use they say that that's very harsh		
and then some people are just apply the word scam a lit much much		
more conservatively and just refer to coins that legitimately are trying to		
scam people out of their money as scams so		
what do we do with this word scam should it ever be applied to coins		
and uh is it a a binary thing or is it the gray area		
hmm it's i think it's definitely a gray area like there's definitely		
things that are really in actual scams like i mean bit connects would be one		
example of uh something that's away on the scam		
spectrum did you see their 2017 promotional video by the way		
big connect yeah hey what's up what's up what's up		
piconic this is it was this three minute 48 second video that was just of this		
guy making this totally crazy rant and it		
was at some conference in vietnam where they were of		
course like trying to convince a whole bunch of people to buy		
this coin and they had this claims about how it would go to go up in value		
yeah that was definitely like the peak of these pure		
completely scammy coins and you know that was definitely really terrible and		
i actually i feel like we have less despite		
cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger we actually have		cryptocurrency
quite a bit less of that now but then of course you know there's this bit this		
spectrum of things that are not completely scams		
um and then things that are not scams and that are technically		
totally fine projects but where the their community is just incredibly		
sketchy and then all the way to you know things		
that are where the community is nice but maybe the		
project is just fundamentally incapable of achieving what it's trying to do or		
in the community doesn't realize and then		
you know a really good project right so like		
if you want to go a step like well if that's 100 scam then like you		
know what would i call like say 80 scam well like bitcoin sv is		bitcoin
one example this is a craig wright's fork of bitcoin		bitcoin
like theoretically it's a blockchain right it's a fork of bitcoin		blockchain, bitcoin
it has some you know 500 12 megabyte blocks		
if you really wanted to you could use the blockchain you know it's uh		blockchain
it satisfies the property is that you know you can send transactions		
onto it you can probably um you know use it as		
as a backup to store your files if you really wanted to just because it has		
it has so much space you know it might fail but		
like it's the but at the same time like you know as they basically said		
like craig wright is a scammer and like half the you know		
community is just totally bad insane so the humans		
the humans of a particular cryptocurrency is what makes for a scam		cryptocurrency
and not like the humans at the top that have a voice		
right guiding the community yeah like i think you know in the case of bsv like		
the humans they yeah make just completely wrong and just		
obviously wrong claims about like what bsv is		
capable of accomplishing and like what it concealed we could		
accomplish and like there's just a lot of aspects of it that make it feel		
like a money grab so that's one example and then you know you gotta go a bit		
further and then you know you have like the trons of the world		
and like you know that's a platform you know you can use it you can do		
you can do stuff on it but at the same time like you know		
they did plagiarize the ipfs white paper and then		
you know they had so the scammy qualities yeah see the thing that throws		
me off a lot this makes it very difficult for me		
is that most coins but the ones that make me feel like are		
scammy have a large community of people that are super positive about it		
like and they'll write to me now that said sort of on the flip side		
of that bitcoin people are also very positive		bitcoin
there's some sense and the the reason i was		
having like squinty eyes looking at bitcoin		bitcoin
for quite a while is like why is everyone so		
positive i was getting total cult vibes like like the ideas are not grounded in		
truth but are grounded in an obsession of like when you can artificially		
conjure up a truth which is why i was a little bit like worried about bitcoin		bitcoin
i think i've learned a lot since then to where like		
um i i learned to separate the community from the ideas		
and i think bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on on many fronts		bitcoin
but still a community that's like dogmatically excited about something		
whatever that is makes me skeptical maybe it's just like my upbringing		
but when everybody's really excited about something		
it makes me um it makes me skeptical and it make but it also makes me		
difficult to decide what is this cam or not because some of the most exciting		
ideas in this world have a community of people who are		
excited about it right because it's um i don't know i think space exploration		
is super exciting and uh and there's people i know a lot		
of them that are exceptionally excited about space		
exploration does that mean it's a scam no no uh		
so i don't know what to do with that and so mostly i just try to stay away		
i suppose but it's it's unfortunate because i'm sure there's a lot of		
exciting technologies in that space i mean like in the case of		
bitcoin like i would definitely not call bitcoin as cam right		bitcoin
right i would not i would i would also not call litecoin a scam		
there's people who call litecoin scam because they just like say oh look you		
know it has no fundamental use case and the		
concept of being silver to bitcoin bitcoin's gold is just like stupid and		bitcoin
you know it's a bit like millie bitcoin is the silver to		bitcoin
bitcoin's gold um but the at the same time like if you have		bitcoin
these people who are just you know they do seem to earnestly		
believe this and uh like they are trying to just like		
make like one be a litecoin as as best as they can then like that's		
to me that's enough for it to not be a scam yeah um		
that's and then so yeah i think the the biggest gray area		
is definitely between like projects that		
are earnest and but you know they have just all sorts of these		
like different combinations of flawed qualities to them yeah yeah		
i mean the the ones that legitimately is a scam is when		
the key people that are at the head of the project are intentionally lying		
and i think as long as their the intent is to try to do good in the world even		
if the your actual implementation of that is		
flawed i think that's not a scam it could be flawed ideas it could be		
wrong ideas but it's not a scam i'm learning to navigate this space yeah		
it's definitely a very challenging space to navigate i mean you		
know it's uh in some ways a reflection of the world		
at large yeah and as we've said maybe offline		
that the fact that money is evolved makes it		
a little bit more complicated that um you know lives can be ruined		
by um by by the choice of technologies that are taking on so		
it makes it more real more painful more like		
elevated the impact of this like imagine like mac versus pc wars if everyone who		
bought a macbook had 10 apple shares inside of it and		
everyone who had a pc had 10 microsoft shares inside of it		
and then you had you know the the elites who bought		
their macs back in 1983 and that they spent 500		
dead and now they have 40 million dollars and they just think that they're		
these gurus who understands the future of finance and geopolitics and		
they make theories about why you know apple is the one that's going to bring		
freedom to the world and uh window is like you know secretly		
allied with the access of evil oh that's brilliant so yes this is so		
brilliant so i think the right way to think about this is we map		
the some of the cryptocurrency battles into the space of like emacs versus vim		cryptocurrency
or apple versus pc if there was some stock that came along		
with each each implementation of the you know		
uh each pc each mac that's fascinating this is 100 correct		
100 correct because then that really energizes the armies of people debating		
over this in a way that something without money does not okay		
let me ask you about something really fascinating that you are also		
excited about which is longevity anti-aging you have donated money to the		
sense foundation so you have an interest in this whole space of lifespan research		
what's your vision here or what do you hope to see in		
anti-aging and longevity research i think i hope to see the concept of		
what of us seeing your parents and grandparents die just slowly disappear		
from the public consciousness as an experience that happens		
over the course of uh half a century the same way that getting lost in		
a city slowly disappeared over the public consciousness over the last 50		
now that we have smartphones the thing you have from nick bostrom the		
essay uh pinned in your twitter is argues that		
essentially that you know death is almost unethical like the fact that we		
don't do something about this thing that um		
this in the essays is a dragon that keeps		
like murdering everybody around us including our parents and grandparents		
is uh like the fact that we don't try to do		
something aggressively about that dragon is uh doesn't make any sense um		
so you think this is a battle worth fighting a battle for immortality or at		
least longevity i'd say absolutely and i'd say it's a		
battle where we're really have started over the last		
five years in particular to see the first cracks of uh no humanities		
and me starting to make things that look like they'll turn into victories		
do you uh do you think humans can eventually live forever		
and maybe as a side comment to that what technology do you think will enable that		
is a genetic modification is it cloning is it uploading your mind		
define forever like are we talking a thousand years a million		
10 to the 14 10 to the 45 well let's start as i tweeted today		
eventually everything uh the universe will be filled with		
supermassive black holes so that that forever maybe like		
backtracking to work we'll have we'll have 10 the		
16 years to figure it out yes uh yeah maybe travel between um		
between the multiverse between the different universes the multiverse		
i mean but forever meaning like you know uh millennia um um		
i guess i definitely think that we can get there i definitely think that it's		
the sort of thing that's going to take an insanely huge amount of		
work and i definitely think it's the sort of thing where		
you know once we figure out the first crop of problems and		
like people start living to 150 we'll just realize that there's like 10 other		
problems that kill you half a slowly and will have to do more work		
but you know the good news is that this this is you know aubry's longevity		
escape velocity argument that if you get everyone to lift 250 now then		
you know you have half a century to fix all those other problems as well so yeah		
i'm optimistic for that reason i think um		
it you definitely do not want to underestimate		
uh human ingenuity especially over the long term but just to look at what		
happens to computers between you know the eniac in 1950 and where we are in		
2020 right like that's a span of 70 years um so like you know		
both of us i think with uh you know even just present-day		
technology and we have at least 70 more years to left		
so just like imagine what kind of sea change will happen in biomedicine		
during that time and the other thing that made me optimistic is that i		
actually think covet has been this kind of		
event that's really a kind of pushed um biomedicine and especially like		
activist approaches to biomedicine really into the public consciousness		
right like it basically it's put people into this mindset that		
you know wait but like you know it's not just like you know the		
bits and tweets that are going to save the world you know the bio		
is actually like super important and huge and um		
you know ultimately what's uh ending the ending covid basically you know is that		
the vaccines and the vaccines have just been you know amazing		
and uh if you can take that energy and start and also like this uh		
i think philosophical attitude that i've noticed like i think		
the way that i would describe the philosophical attitude here		
this is going more depth first is that i think		
the way that i kind of interpret part of what i would call late 20th century		
ideology is that there is this mentality that		
you know nature is good and disruptions from nature		
are bad and generally you want to minimize disruptions from nature		
and like this exists everywhere in the political spectrum right so there's		
nature as in literal nature and my view is that like the right wing		
version of that is market sas nature right um markets as nature yeah like you		
know they the way that that like that kind of		
philosophy talks about you know markets and like the goal of not		
interfering with them like you know it's it is very kind of like nature styled		
and then of course you know the the conservative one which is like		
traditional culture that existed before the activists		
started controlling everything as also being a kind of nature		
um but the 21st century attitude and like really covet you know		
has flipped a lot of minds because with kovid what's happened is that well		
no like it's not nature is not safe right the default is like		
you know untold and misery and suffering and tens of millions of people dying		
the only way out for us is through like basically um human ingenuity		
and that frame of mind is one that's like much more friendly		
to one uh the this other um change of minds that i want to see		
which is like basically treating aging as an engineering problem		
right like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings that are currently		
on this earth are going to die and they're going		
to live their last decade of life in a debilitating pain		
and the only way to stop that is human ingenuity		
and you know we don't we don't have that solution yet but you know if we work		
hard we will and more and more people on the biology		
side computational biology are basically converting the mess of the		
the human biology into an engineering problem		
and once that conversion is happening looking at the		
the genetical the proteins all those kinds of things once that conversion		
happens you can now apply the tools that we know		
how to solve engineering problems to solving it that way and then there's		
also the other version which is you know why do we romanticize this meat		
vehicle that ultimately is just the thing that		
carries the brain maybe we can more and more convert ourselves into the		
digital realm this is where like neural link yeah i		
have the brain computer interfaces and then achieve		
immortality in the space of information in the digital space versus the		
biology space that stuff's interesting too i agree again i think		
you know we we have enough resources and we should just try all the parallel		
tracks you know it's great that we have people just trying to make our bodies		
work it's great that we have people trying to		
upload like or improve brain scanning it's also great that we have		
just like people improving cryonics so like we could just like		
you know go to sleep in the freezer and um eventually		
hopefully sometime in the future you know healthy is going to be able to wake		
up um all of this uh um you know you know anyone who		
gets chronically frozen today will be able to wake up but you know		
that's all that's a bad right that's the last resort and then		
the other interesting thing about um the like		
extreme uploading approach right is um like		
we're excited about space and one of the points that uh a lot of science		
or like hard science fiction types make is that you know if you want to explore		
space that's a lot easier if you're not a human		
right like one example of this is that you know		
in the context of humans we're talking about like oh we're going to be able to		
go to the moon oh we're going to be able to go to mars		
but there's this project called starshot i believe right that's basically trying		
to send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to		
alpha centauri and they literally believe that they're		
going to be able to get spacecraft over to alpha centauri like four light years		
away by like the 2060s no i mean by traveling		
close to the speed of light yeah exactly like		
so based the way it works is you know you have these light sails like you		
basically take the as a spacecraft and you shine a laser at it		
and the laser is insanely strong and quickly accelerated at		
100 g's no i think it was 10 000 gs um until it gets to 20 the speed of		
light and then you know it goes on your merry way		
right so if you wants to be in um like personally explore the alpha		
centauri system within like two centuries or once or one		
century then you know being a robot is like		
by far the most practical way to do it because there's no way that a human		
being can survive 10 000 years so it's it's definitely interesting long		
term but at the same time like there's definitely a lot of like		
psychological hang-ups and a lot of like deep philosophy that we'll just have to		
grapple with well i think to get there i think what		
it hangs on the topic of whether we can convert		
consciousness into an engineering problem so like		
is consciousness tied to our biology because the moment we can		
convert consciousness into a digital form then we can		
send it with that light sale to office centauri until then		
a robot is not carrying anything except maybe some basic knowledge like		
wikipedia it's not carrying the flame of human consciousness i have		
high hopes for converting consciousness into		
engineering problem in fact i think it's not as difficult as		
people think i'm i agree with that i'm definitely in the		
camp that consciousness is a property of the algorithm and not a		
property of brain structure um the other fun like the kinds of		
philosophical things we'd have to grab with grapple with is like		
once you upload yourself like you can hit control c you know like		
it would be wouldn't be lovely to have like 10 copies of fellow experience		
like we could just interview everyone so this is i mean this is		
i i have to ask this question it's a difficult one which		
i don't think he'll be wonderful first of all um		
sure so in the following way and this has to do with immortality as well		
there's something about scarcity that creates		
value or um there's a bunch of philosophers victor franco		
bernard williams ernest becker they argue that		
death or the scarcity of life creates meaning		
and the reason we life is beautiful the reason so many moments of experience		
of of love or delicious food		
all those things are made delicious because they're		
finite because they end and because we don't have that many of them		
and there's a kind of worry that if we extend the human lifespan		
if we achieve immortality or if we god forbid		
clone me multiple times then you lose the		
richness of what it means to have this life to have this		
experience does that worry you at all do you think		
there's some aspect to which death does in fact give meaning to life		
i guess like the one historical parallel and like		
this might be a bit unfair is that you know		
there have been philosophers that said that have said things like		
you know war gives like meaning to human collectives and		
the struggle for supremacy between you know nations and races as this		
like big driver of progress that like that ensures that ever that everyone		
strives to be their best and um you know of course uh this		
viewpoint got into the head of a crazy austrian guy and 20 years later his		
soldiers were shooting at my grandparents		
um so you know these days we don't really		
have that but yet life still feels meaningful there's we've still found		
other ways to uh or them like they're still		
uh striving for technological progress there's still		
um you know uh striving for self-improvement in general		
and it turns out that you know you don't actually need to have existential		
conflicts in order to in order to have that now maybe you need		
conflict but we have other kinds of conflicts right look we have you know		
competition between businesses competition between political ideologies		
competition between projects and so you know these are like whatever		
what whatever the psychological needs are		
like they're just our substitutes for it so i guess like yeah so if we uh		
i'm trying to say i i feel like once we start		
living to to the age of uh 200 then like i'm just intuitively expecting that		
we'll see some like substitutes emerge in the same way yeah		
that will will create conflicts of other		
sorts that lead to less human suffering than wars do like we'll just start		
playing diablo four five six and because you die in video games so maybe		
we'll get some of the inkling of scarcity		
through the activities we partake in as opposed to our own body dying		
i mean i feel shitty when i uh like you can		
i remember in diablo three you can play in hardcore mode		
where if you die in the game your character is dead maybe you will		
get the the richness of like what that we currently get from		
life by having like little artificial versions of ourselves		
that die interestingly enough as i've just like personally		
spent more time in this world i've started realizing that you know there is		
a concept of like real fight finiteness that still like		
exists and it might even still be a thing that provides meaning that doesn't		
require anyone to actually die like for example like how many people		
from middle school or even high school or		
yours like do you still talk to regularly		
i'm happy to be close friends with like four or five of them okay well like in		
my case the answer is zero for middle school and two for high school		
you're right right it dropped exactly it dropped		
right and so like there's a lot of these just like relationships that end up		
being very finite um a person changes their i feel like a		
person changes enough of their worldview after 25 years wasn't there even a study		
about this something like a person and themselves 25 years later		
about as different as like two different people or		
something like this um so you know like i mean just like you		
can have conflict without bloodshed i think um you know you can		
you can have finiteness and even you know the the necessary		
sorrows of uh finiteness that give meaning without		
like literally any anyone having to end their life		
and hopefully if we do extend our life we'll figure out ways to extend		
the period of time where there's newer neuroplasticity yes to where we could		
change our world views continually throughout		
that time so have some of these different phases of		
life uh i thought it would be fun to hear you		
speak a little russian [Music]		
do you think there's uh so for people who don't speak russian		
that uh vitalik said that there is um that there is something to the spirit of		
the people that are russian that are working		
in the cryptocurrency world that uh is a little bit different and		cryptocurrency
it and it's something that uh that connects to some kind of aspect of your		
own self some kind of roots there it it it's		
it's kind of interesting do you think that there's um		
does it make you sad that there's these two different worlds		
that are uh sort of in part disconnected by		
language and i'm sure the same could be the case with china and other parts of		
the world or the language		
slows the transmission of the beauty of the culture		
in a certain kind of way where you can't truly collaborate like you can		
all speak english you're collaborating on maybe a technical level		
but you're not collaborating on the level of like		
some deep human connection do you see that being able to speak both languages		
there's definitely benefits i think to be able to like		
speak multiple languages and like once you can right like you it you discover		
that like even your mindset changes while you're in speaking in one language		
versus the other like people have told me this like		
when i speak russian i sound more like i guess like to the point in pragmatic		
when i speak chinese i sound more cute when i		
speak english i'm something else um i guess		
there's definitely like a richness that you're missing if you're only		
like in one of these language bubbles but		
you know i guess the arguments on the other side would be that you know if		
everyone spoke the same language then like		
there would just be one bubble right this is the challenge i think like		
there are actually benefits to having cultural diversity and you definitely		
don't want the entire world to be too conformist		
yeah and well one of the interesting things about crypto is that it's just		crypto
a culture that actually like manages to like		
somehow you know have its uniqueness and brazil and even preserve its		
independence from all of all of these surrounding		
countries despite being embedded in all of them		
so it uh spans outside the geographical boundaries		
and language in some ways does as well and then in the way these cultures		
these bubbles are created i mean they overlap in interesting ways it's almost		
like a hierarchy and the same is the case with the crypto world		crypto
there's uh you know there's communities associated with these cryptocurrencies		
there's communities within those communities		
and it's yeah i mean i think like you know it's definitely sad whenever these		
groups are are fighting each other um and like it's		
definitely good for them to like if people can cooperate more um		
but you know at the same time like just having		
like groups of people that have you know different kinds of life experiences like		
there's definitely something benefit from that so let me ask one last		
question i don't think i asked you last time		
the ridiculous question about the meaning of life uh		
you know dostoevsky said beauty will save the world		
some people believe money is a big part of happiness and		
you've turned first of all you've made a lot of money		
you turned away a lot of money he turned away a lot of power		
so you're a fascinating person to ask what do you think is meaning to life		
the thing that i've realized with money as i uh		
have experienced both having a little of it and i'm having a lot of it		
is that um the benefit of like you can get the most out of um		
money if you think of it not as something that like lets you do and have		
more things but as something that lets you worry about		
fewer things right like you know if you have you know if the		
your savings are just you know non-zero at all then		
you don't have to worry as much about losing your job and		
you know if you feel like you're you have a job that just like really		
conflicts with your values then like if you have even six months saved		
up that just makes it easier for you to say bye-bye i'm going to do something		
else if you have more money then you can		
[Music] you know not worry about like even what		
you're doing the am needing to be profitable at all um once		
you get more money then like you can you know choose		
transportation options and food options that just like		
have less hassle in your life and allow you to be lazier uh		
so if you like this aspect of just like reducing		
troubles and like opening up room for um other		
things i think is a big part of it like if you just if you		
instead think of money as being like this positive		
or this thing that like gives you stuff and you try to		
derive meaning from the stuff i think that's uh		
much more likely to be like a road to like basically squandering that		
opportunity so yeah and i guess my philosophy is on		
that is definitely more subtractive than added over there		
but once you have enough money that you don't have to worry about the money		
you're burdened with another question which is of meaning and		
do you think there's meaning to it all or		
it seems like your own life you're trying to build cool stuff that		
alleviates some level of suffering in the world		
well i mean one way to think about it is like		
think of think back to like how you thought about life when you were in		
school right well in school this is interesting		
to think about right because in a lot of ways like it's just totally		
outside of bounds of you know the kinds of systems that are		
like social systems that we live in as um as adults or maybe not like maybe		
things like academia are intended to replicate parts of school		
like first of all school is very totalitarian right like		
you know you have to follow the teacher the the teacher's instructions the bulk		
of your schedule is like forced to be in particular areas and you know you can		
control um and they're real for you from you know		
leaving the grounds during this period this period of time um you know assign a		
lot of homework but at the same time also you know		
school is a bit of a bit of a post-scarcity utopia in that		
you just don't have to worry about getting resources for yourself		
and you know we've both like lived through 12 years of that		
right so you know like what does that say about us and i think		
like in one thing of aspect obviously is that		
in it does like there's definitely like an		
easiness to living life if all of your decisions are made for you		
and one of the challenges of adulthood i guess is moving to this uh		
world where like all your choices are much more self-directed and you just		
have to like learn to live and deal with that um		
yeah dealing with the burden of freedom in some sense actually interesting and		
because uh i in some ways i feel like even my first		
like five years of doing ethereum things uh yeah		ethereum
my life was not even all that self-directed because for a lot of it		
was just you know responding to obligations right		
like someone said oh you know come to speak at this event		
in korea okay you know come to speak of this thing in taiwan okay		
um oh like we need up for ethereum to launch we need		ethereum
um you know this particular piece to be done and tested okay work on that		
right we know we need some uh um a proof of stake algorithm work on that		
and the last year of uh coved life um like basically i was like		
holed up in singapore for much of it right and it gave me a lot more alone		
time you know i had much less travel and that was definitely a very new and		
interesting experience for me would you characterize it by sadness		
melancholy hope uh dreaming like innovative period like how		
would you characterize that alone time sum of all five um definitely some		
self-discovery um i definitely did like take this uh		
make this very deliberate decision that like okay i have this time and		
i'm going to like actually make something meaningful out of it		
um so like one example of the things i did is i just like actually		
started really listening to our um audiobooks and podcasts much more		
like just this year i basically kind of discovered that the podcast space is		
real for the first time i guess like before that you know there would be		
things that i would get interviewed for but yeah i		
was not really kind of like mentally incorporated i		
did not mentally incorporate this um idea that like podcasts are a thing that		
you can go listen to and this year i did okay you know my		
friend uh um carl lafourche one of the the		
optimism people uh recommended hardcore history to me		
and so i went ahead and just listens to all the hardcore histories uh		
but then after that like yeah listen to like 10 lux		
speedmans and then a bunch of others says and		
after that i also got into um audiobooks um oh i listened to the entire um		
the rise and fall of the third reich the whole thing 45 hours		
that that was fascinating so what else did you ask about because dana's gonna		
love hearing this i'm gonna tell you do you have uh do you have a period of		
history whether it's dan or in general that you draw for your own life like		
kind of thinking about the world about human nature that you go to		
is it world war ii is it uh wrath of the cons the		
injengus is it some other more ancient history		
is it world war one is there something that kind of echoes with you		
in the voice of dan or or anyone else that you connect to		
i feel like the 1930s and 40s are fascinating because they force you to		
like really grapple with uh the question of like you know where does		
evil come from right like the sort of mental puzzle that i've always		
had in my head is like on the one hand um you know		
things like the holocaust happened but on the other hand if you just go and		
like have a coffee with with uh people then like a hundred times		
out of a hundred everyone just seems so nice		
yeah yeah so yeah exactly yeah like how do you		
kind of reconcile the macro in the micro there right		
and that's the sort of thing that's very difficult		
if you don't have um a lot of i guess the right kind of		
personal experience like especially if your personal experience		
starts off being sheltered like it was for me right like i you know this		
i know the stereotype is that the nerds get bullied in school but like actually		
for me in my school experience was just being		
treated with kindness by everyone yeah and so that definitely made it harder to		
understand things i remember actually being pretty		
blindsided when i started ethereum and then		ethereum
within six months there started being fights over like who would get more		
shares if ethereum turned out to be a company and		ethereum
then i suggested we should just make it be a non-profit and somehow that ended		
up upsetting people um so		
so the fascinating thing for me is that like i've been you know		
obviously reading and listening to the history and then at the same time just		
like observing things happening in the crypto		crypto
space and so one of my interesting		
um like mental intuitions that i've gotten is that i think		
like most evil doesn't come out of greed it comes out of fear		
and like one example of this in ethereum lands right is um		ethereum
like i think the part of ethereum history where i thought that the		ethereum
ethereum community was at its lowest and even when i personally was at my lowest		ethereum
and if you go back to the dow fork in 2016 right		
so you know the dow hack happens and then we made this controversial decision		
to change the ethereum protocol uh and we um		ethereum, protocol
you know then there was that ethereum classic split and		ethereum
as soon as that ethereum classic split um happened		ethereum
you know there was like a lot of anger everywhere and		
there started there started especially being anger when		
the price of etc started like taking up right so this was the time when		
ether started off being 13 dollars and then ethereum classic started at zero		ethereum
but then suddenly there was this one day when		
like eath dropped to 12.5 etc went up to 0.5		
and then they dropped more and people were saying things like		
um you know oh this whole thing ethereum classic is just as like a psyop by		ethereum
you know the bitcoin community and just the wealthy bitcoiners trying to destroy		bitcoin
ethereum and like in the back of my mind i knew		ethereum
that that wasn't entirely true like there were definitely were		
bitcoiners but at the same time like i think		
blaming political like internal disa or blaming disagreements on foreign		
interference right like this is the sort of thing that you know like		
countries governments do all the time like it's		
a very convenient excuse right because it allows you to just like		
blame these things that are happening on the foreigners and		
avoid like actually grappling with the facts that like well no actually you		
have people in your very own community who just		
disagree with you and have a different belief and		
i think you know i feel like the ethereum community like during that time		ethereum
did not do a very good job of grappling with that and i feel like like i during		
that time did not do a very good job of grappling		
with that and so there was a lot of like blaming the		
bitcoiners there were also even a lot of people calling for us to use		
trademark one like basically sue exchanges		
and like try to prevent them from listing ethereum classic		ethereum
and like to me that was very unethical right like this uh		
using like basically using the government as		
a weapon to uh try to attack the other cryptocurrency and like destroy		cryptocurrency
it as like goes completely against them you know the ideals of freedom and you		
know like things that at least in theory were supposed to stand for um		
but you know like in that particular time		
like basically what was happening was that you know the		
etc price was rising and at the same time the th price was dropping in		
lockstep and it really and there are a lot of		
bitcoin people basically saying this is the end of ethereum and i think a lot of		ethereum, bitcoin
people really were afraid that ethereum would be just like completely		ethereum
destroyed as a result of this and so like that's where the anger came
