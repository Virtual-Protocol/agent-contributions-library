and building a team ethereum officially launched as a project in January 2014		ethereum
and was co-founded by vitalik buteran Joe Lubin mahai Ali Z Charles hoskinson	

Anthony delaurio and Gavin wood to gather funds the team held an initial		
coin offering which sold ether tokens in return for funds the ico-based		
crowdfunding event amassed 16 million dollars worth of bitcoin which was		bitcoin
enough for buteran and his crew to jumpstart the cryptocurrency by founding		cryptocurrency
the ethereum foundation an organization that guided and planned out ethereum's		ethereum
development numerous versions were tested changed and refined by July 2015		
a stable version of ethereum arrives to the public under the name of Frontier a		ethereum
more user-friendly iteration launched in March 2016 which propelled the project		
to new highs both in terms of value and adoption exchanges began listing ether		

in mass and the number of nodes supporting the ethereum network nearly		ethereum
surpassed those of Bitcoin and the rest is history ethereum went on to become		ethereum, bitcoin
the second largest cryptocurrency in the entire blockchain industry and it hosted		blockchain, cryptocurrency
nearly all of the sector's decentralized applications		decentralized
even today ethereum holds strongly onto its position and many believe that it is		ethereum
impossible for any other smart contract ecosystem to replace buteran's creation		
but as with any other project ethereum also had its bad moments during the last		ethereum
Bull Run and some were dangerous enough to shake the Project's foundations the		
first dramatic event that occurred was the launch of the Dow a decentralized	
decentralized
autonomous organization that brought a new e-governance system on the		
blockchain during its Ico the Dow collected 150 million dollars for more		blockchain
than 11 000 investors in a historical crowdfunding round but the trouble began		
the moment the project launched a hacker discovered an exploit in the Dow's open		
source code which allowed him to create a copy of the project and steal its		
funds stealing around 50 million dollars the security issue was dramatic enough		
for ethereum to fall from twenty dollars to thirteen dollars in a single day		ethereum
decentralization prevents entered the Dao's developers from making any Swift		dao
decisions so ethereum resorted to going nuclear		ethereum
the entire network hard forked migrating to a version of ethereum before the hack		ethereum
occurred the event raised concerns about ethereum's own decentralization which		ethereum
resulted in the creation of ethereum classic although a majority of users and		ethereum
miners decided to join the new blockchain some have decided to stay		blockchain
with the old one blockchain industry was shaken to the core one more time on June		blockchain
25th 2017 when online trolls from 4chan began to spread fake stories of vitalik		
buteran's death Anonymous individuals spread rumors of a car crash incident		
that resulted in ethereum losing 4 billion dollars of its market value		ethereum
the fake news forced buteran to post a selfie to prove that he is alive and		
soon after the market retraced to its former value		

the bizarre chain of events was enough for investors to realize that buteran's		
existence is crucial for the blockchain industry without him the dream of a		blockchain

journey started after the developers of World of Warcraft ruined his game		
resulting in a newly found interest for all things decentralized vitalik may not		decentralized
be Satoshi but he doesn't need to be with his expertise bright mind and		
philosophical outlook on decentralized governance buteran had enough of an		decentralized
impact on the blockchain industry to at least come near to nakamoto's own		blockchain
Ingenuity the arrival of ethereum 2.0 buteran has the chance to shake the 
ethereum
industry One More Time by introducing a truly scalable blockchain protocol will		blockchain, protocol
