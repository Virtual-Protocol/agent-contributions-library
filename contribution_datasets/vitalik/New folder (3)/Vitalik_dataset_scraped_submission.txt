okay so Felix asks when we see a breakdown in a current financial system and fiat currencies of the world are losing value do you see a theory amande		
the benefits of blockchain tech replacing current systems first of all I will say that I'm my probability estimation that you know finding a world		Crypto		Blockchain
financial systems or collapse and fiat currencies all hyper-inflated is much much lower than it was you know four years ago that one I thought that		
Austrian atomic so like the world um but you know and I think you know Krypton watching can still have value even in a current context you know regardless of		
whether it's set like we like whether you're dealing with hyperinflation or you know sort of money in a low inflation and negative interest rates I		
mean but if some kind of major failure mode does happen then I mean that a I would say yes that is good for crypto and like my general view there is that		Crypto		Crypto
that's I mean there's a couple of things there and one of them is that if there is some failure of basic with sort of traditional sort of legal regulatory		
complex to provide the safety that people expect to that then there will be increased interest in crypto to provide that safety instead you know with you		Crypto		Crypto
know some combination of mathematical guarantees security deposit zero counterparty in the risk and so forth then from a pure kind of asset		General		Security
standpoint I think the interesting thing with like things like you know Bitcoin and you know like coin and so forth those that just generally		Crypto		Bitcoin
cryptocurrencies is that even though even if you assume that nobody uses over transactions and US you can actually come up with an economic one of model		
where they routine value and in the very long term their value actually grow is that roughly the same rate as you know world GDP per capita core world GDP and		
you know people just use them as annoying portion of their of their investment portfolio even though it's not they don't kind of have any		General		Investment
world use case and the reason is that basically it's this kind of self reinforced equilibrium argument that if people see that this asset class you		
know number one goes up roughly with royal GDP in the long term and number two you know go sort of has short term ups and downs own schedule that said		
this you know kind of disconnected from the way the schedule on which stocks go up and down then it'll just become my natural financial strategy to kind of		
diversify some portion of your of your funds into that in order to every basically reduced risk and kind of protect yourselves for yourself for		
mortgage sharks to some degree and so if people follow that strategy then over time people will keep putting more and more of their money into it as world GDP		
increases and so the you know the prophecy will become kind of self-fulfilling in the long term so fear but basically even you know the you know		
these things could actually become you know a part of the war of how the world stores this value now there's a question of whether or not that's good or bad for		
society I think that I mean first of all a lot of the bad for society could be mitigated if the basic work got eliminated and replacement proof of		
stake because you know Chris Griffin work is as you know hugely wasteful environmentally unfriendly and we as a group of stake isn't but at the same		
time you also have to realize that I think you know it might be the case that the world wants assets that kind of behave that way you know sort of that		
behave that way and just have value because we you know and that sort of gross with real GDP in the long term and that's uncorrelated with us with the		
stock market and that the market will find assets to serve that function and if pure assets to sort you know kind of what crypto asset see that don't exist		Crypto		Crypto, General		Market
then the market will just find other assets to take off that role instead and you know that could be look at the housing market for example because land		General		Market
is affects supply commodity and in you could make the case that having that kind of long term schedule that's attached		
moved from things on points that have secondary uses on to things like basically just crypto Telugu you know Bitcoin could have a benefit because		Crypto		Bitcoin, Crypto		Crypto
people that wants to use the land for its primary function of you know living at it and you know doing that having businesses on it or going to being they		
want you to use it more cheaply and have potentially have less volatility risk because it's by folding interest will be somewhere else okay so we just got a
