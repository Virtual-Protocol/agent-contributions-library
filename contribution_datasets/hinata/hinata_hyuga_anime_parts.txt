0	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in the Chūnin Exams being held in Konoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat.
1	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter the Forest of Death with the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner, Akamaru, senses the Three Sand Siblings' fight with Team Shigure. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified when Gaara mercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest.
2	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of the Hyūga Clan Secret Ointment so that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin, Neji Hyūga. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hyūga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says.
3	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchange Gentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed her tenketsu at the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her.
4	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. When Hayate Gekkō is about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observing jōnin. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team of medical-nin to be given emergency medical attention.
5	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	After a month, on the day of the Chūnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at the Third Training Ground. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him. Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that. Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as ""weird"" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away.
6	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	Hinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again. Kiba gets an Anbu (Kabuto Yakushi) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.
7	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Chūnin Exams	In the anime, Team 8 (at Hinata's insistence) helps Naruto find a bikōchū, which he can use to locate Sasuke by scent. After a day of searching, Hinata goes off by herself and trains by a waterfall in order to create a new jutsu. Naruto sees her, though he doesn't realise it's Hinata; she becomes embarrassed when he later tells Kiba about the ""beautiful girl"" he saw. When they are attacked by members of the Kamizuru clan, Hinata uses her new Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms to save her team. Although they ultimately fail in their plan to use the bikōchū to find Sasuke, their near-success earns praise from Hinata's father, Hiashi.

21	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	In the anime, Kakashi Hatake recruits Team 8's members to help him investigate one of Orochimaru's recently-discovered bases. During their investigation, they are attacked by some of Orochimaru's subordinates, Team Guren. When Kiba struggles against Nurari, Hinata switches with him, using her Byakugan to navigate through the smoke Nurari employs. The team's leader, Guren, soon traps Team 8 in her Jade Crystal Labyrinth Technique. Although the labyrinth's reflective surface makes it difficult for her to focus with her Byakugan, Hinata is able to locate Guren and defeat one of her Jade Crystal Clones, but is then encased in a crystal prison, where she remains until found by Team 7.
22	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	When they come across the Three-Tails, Hinata is assigned to a team tasked with sealing it. They are interrupted by Team Guren before they can complete the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier, prompting Konoha to recall them and send Anbu to seal the Three-Tails in their place.
23	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	Teams 7 and 8 are combined into an Eight Man Squad with the mission of locating Sasuke or Itachi Uchiha. When they split up to search, Naruto, because he's a target of Akatsuki, is given a protective escort in the form of Hinata, Yamato, and Bull. Their group is soon confronted by Kabuto Yakushi, who offers them intel on Akatsuki and its members. Noticing something strange about Kabuto, Hinata examines him with her Byakugan and discovers that a third of his body has been taken over by Orochimaru's remains. Kabuto escapes and they later regroup with the rest of the team. Kiba is able to find Sasuke's trail, which they begin following.
24	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	When Pain's Assault on Konoha begins, Hinata joins her teammates in defending the village. Pain later destroys the village, but Hinata is saved from harm by Katsuyu. Hinata's bodyguard, Kō Hyūga, is not as fortunate, but he refuses Hinata's attempts to find him medical attention. Hinata watches as Naruto fights Pain alone, initially obeying Katsuyu's and Kō's instructions not to interfere. After Naruto is captured by Pain's Deva Path, however, Hinata does not hesitate to come to his defence, forcing the Deva Path away from him. Naruto pleads for her to run away, telling her that she can't defeat Pain. Despite knowing this already, she tells Naruto that she will fight Pain because, after years of watching him and improving herself by following his example, Hinata loves Naruto and will do what she can to protect him.
25	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	Hinata starts attacking the Deva Path with her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists. In the anime, she succeeds in removing some of the black receivers that restrains Naruto and even hitting the Deva Path, but the outcome remains the same: the Deva Path quickly defeats her with Shinra Tensei. The Deva Path then stabs her with another black receiver, leading Naruto to believe Hinata has been killed and thus causing him to enter a version 2 form. Hinata, however, is still alive, and when Team Guy finds her, Neji gets her immediate medical attention. Sakura Haruno heals Hinata's injuries, allowing her to tearfully join in the village's celebration when Naruto returns after defeating Pain.
26	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	News reaches Konoha of Sasuke's recent activity with Akatsuki, specifically his attack against Kumogakure-ninja. Hinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 (while Naruto was absent) decide that Sasuke can no longer be allowed to implicate Konoha in his criminal deeds and they resolve to personally kill him. When Naruto returns to Konoha after learning of this and having his own confrontation with Sasuke, he requests that they leave dealing with Sasuke to him.
27	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	In the anime, Hinata was present at the Hyūga clan meeting convened by her father, Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she was quite shocked. After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.[52]
28	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	Later, Hinata met with Kurenai and was told that several members of the Konoha 11 have encountered Naruto while he traveled to the Land of Lightning. When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the Fifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War. She was later invited to Yakiniku Q to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.
29	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	When the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Hinata is placed alongside Neji in the Second Division. Their entire division is sent to intercept a large segment of the White Zetsu Army, which Neji and Hinata join forces in attacking after Kitsuchi unearths the Zetsu army. Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition. After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.
30	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	In the anime, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino investigate a possible breach of the Allied Shinobi Forces' perimeter. They discover several White Zetsus within Allied territory, and in the fight to destroy them Hinata is knocked unconscious. One Zetsu impersonates her and successfully pretends to be her for a time using its knowledge of her feelings for Naruto, but Kiba and Shino eventually discover it and, after defeating it, rescue Hinata.[53] On the second day of the war, Hinata helps members of the Second Division escape the area of Neji's fight with the reincarnated Kidōmaru. She later finds Neji unconscious with Kiba and Akamaru. Hinata examines their bodies with her Byakugan and discovers that their chakra flow has completely stopped. She reports this to Inoichi Yamanaka, who is able to use the information to help Naruto save them. Hinata tearfully hugs Neji when he wakes up.[54]
31	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	With all levels of the Allied Shinobi Forces infiltrated by disguised White Zetsus, Hinata and the others are placed on high alert due to periodic surprise attacks by what they thought were their allies. When Naruto reaches the Second Division's location he starts identifying and defeating the disguised Zetsus, including three that attempt to attack Hinata. Although Neji is suspicious that Naruto may also be a White Zetsu, Hinata insists it's the real Naruto, which she can tell by looking in his eyes. Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him. She silently thanks him as he leaves.
32	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.
33	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.
34	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the Ten-Tails' clones: she starts performing the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on a Ten-Tails mini-clone, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists.
35	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	When the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.
36	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	With Obito defeated, Naruto goes off to fight Madara, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight a final Zetsu. As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and restrained by the Ten-Tails' roots.
37	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission	While trapped, Hinata dreams of sitting on a park bench with Naruto while they are watched in secret by Neji and Hanabi. Naruto and Sasuke eventually release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, freeing Hinata and the rest of the world and thus ending the Fourth Shinobi World War. They all return to Konoha to bury the dead from the war, with Team Kurenai and Naruto paying their respects at the mass funeral.

When Naruto reaches the Second Division's location he starts identifying and defeating the disguised Zetsus, including three that attempt to attack Hinata. Although Neji is suspicious that Naruto may also be a White Zetsu, Hinata insists it's the real Naruto, which she can tell by looking in his eyes. Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him. She silently thanks him as he leaves.
49	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Akatsuki Suppression Mission	Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.
50	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Akatsuki Suppression Mission	Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.
51	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Akatsuki Suppression Mission	As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the Ten-Tails' clones: she starts performing the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on a Ten-Tails mini-clone, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists.
52	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Akatsuki Suppression Mission	When the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.
53	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Akatsuki Suppression Mission	With Obito defeated, Naruto goes off to fight Madara, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight a final Zetsu. As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and restrained by the Ten-Tails' roots.
54	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Akatsuki Suppression Mission	While trapped, Hinata dreams of sitting on a park bench with Naruto while they are watched in secret by Neji and Hanabi. Naruto and Sasuke eventually release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, freeing Hinata and the rest of the world and thus ending the Fourth Shinobi World War. They all return to Konoha to bury the dead from the war, with Team Kurenai and Naruto paying their respects at the mass funeral.
55	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	Teams 7 and 8 are combined into an Eight Man Squad with the mission of locating Sasuke or Itachi Uchiha. When they split up to search, Naruto, because he's a target of Akatsuki, is given a protective escort in the form of Hinata, Yamato, and Bull. Their group is soon confronted by Kabuto Yakushi, who offers them intel on Akatsuki and its members. Noticing something strange about Kabuto, Hinata examines him with her Byakugan and discovers that a third of his body has been taken over by Orochimaru's remains. Kabuto escapes and they later regroup with the rest of the team. Kiba is able to find Sasuke's trail, which they begin following.
56	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	When Pain's Assault on Konoha begins, Hinata joins her teammates in defending the village. Pain later destroys the village, but Hinata is saved from harm by Katsuyu. Hinata's bodyguard, Kō Hyūga, is not as fortunate, but he refuses Hinata's attempts to find him medical attention. Hinata watches as Naruto fights Pain alone, initially obeying Katsuyu's and Kō's instructions not to interfere. After Naruto is captured by Pain's Deva Path, however, Hinata does not hesitate to come to his defence, forcing the Deva Path away from him. Naruto pleads for her to run away, telling her that she can't defeat Pain. Despite knowing this already, she tells Naruto that she will fight Pain because, after years of watching him and improving herself by following his example, Hinata loves Naruto and will do what she can to protect him.
57	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	Hinata starts attacking the Deva Path with her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists. In the anime, she succeeds in removing some of the black receivers that restrains Naruto and even hitting the Deva Path, but the outcome remains the same: the Deva Path quickly defeats her with Shinra Tensei. The Deva Path then stabs her with another black receiver, leading Naruto to believe Hinata has been killed and thus causing him to enter a version 2 form. Hinata, however, is still alive, and when Team Guy finds her, Neji gets her immediate medical attention. Sakura Haruno heals Hinata's injuries, allowing her to tearfully join in the village's celebration when Naruto returns after defeating Pain.
58	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	News reaches Konoha of Sasuke's recent activity with Akatsuki, specifically his attack against Kumogakure-ninja. Hinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 (while Naruto was absent) decide that Sasuke can no longer be allowed to implicate Konoha in his criminal deeds and they resolve to personally kill him. When Naruto returns to Konoha after learning of this and having his own confrontation with Sasuke, he requests that they leave dealing with Sasuke to him.
59	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	In the anime, Hinata was present at the Hyūga clan meeting convened by her father, Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she was quite shocked. After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.[52]
60	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	Later, Hinata met with Kurenai and was told that several members of the Konoha 11 have encountered Naruto while he traveled to the Land of Lightning. When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the Fifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War. She was later invited to Yakiniku Q to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.
61	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Itachi Pursuit Mission	When the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Hinata is placed alongside Neji in the Second Division. Their entire division is sent to intercept a large segment of the White Zetsu Army, which Neji and Hinata join forces in attacking after Kitsuchi unearths the Zetsu army. Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition. After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.

They discover several White Zetsus within Allied territory, and in the fight to destroy them Hinata is knocked unconscious. One Zetsu impersonates her and successfully pretends to be her for a time using its knowledge of her feelings for Naruto, but Kiba and Shino eventually discover it and, after defeating it, rescue Hinata. On the second day of the war, Hinata helps members of the Second Division escape the area of Neji's fight with the reincarnated Kidōmaru. She later finds Neji unconscious with Kiba and Akamaru. Hinata examines their bodies with her Byakugan and discovers that their chakra flow has completely stopped. She reports this to Inoichi Yamanaka, who is able to use the information to help Naruto save them. Hinata tearfully hugs Neji when he wakes up.

Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him. She silently thanks him as he leaves.
92	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Six-Tails Unleashed	Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.
93	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Six-Tails Unleashed	Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.
94	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Six-Tails Unleashed	As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the Ten-Tails' clones: she starts performing the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on a Ten-Tails mini-clone, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists.
95	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Six-Tails Unleashed	When the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.
96	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Six-Tails Unleashed	With Obito defeated, Naruto goes off to fight Madara, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight a final Zetsu. As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and restrained by the Ten-Tails' roots.

They all return to Konoha to bury the dead from the war, with Team Kurenai and Naruto paying their respects at the mass funeral.

Hinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 (while Naruto was absent) decide that Sasuke can no longer be allowed to implicate Konoha in his criminal deeds and they resolve to personally kill him. When Naruto returns to Konoha after learning of this and having his own confrontation with Sasuke, he requests that they leave dealing with Sasuke to him.
99	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Five Kage Summit	In the anime, Hinata was present at the Hyūga clan meeting convened by her father, Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she was quite shocked. After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.

When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the Fifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War. She was later invited to Yakiniku Q to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.

Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition. After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.

One Zetsu impersonates her and successfully pretends to be her for a time using its knowledge of her feelings for Naruto, but Kiba and Shino eventually discover it and, after defeating it, rescue Hinata. On the second day of the war, Hinata helps members of the Second Division escape the area of Neji's fight with the reincarnated Kidōmaru. She later finds Neji unconscious with Kiba and Akamaru. Hinata examines their bodies with her Byakugan and discovers that their chakra flow has completely stopped.

135	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation	Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.
136	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation	Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.
137	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation	As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the Ten-Tails' clones: she starts performing the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on a Ten-Tails mini-clone, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists.
138	https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga	Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation	When the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.

As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and restrained by the Ten-Tails' roots.
