Hinata Uzumaki (うずまきヒナタ, Uzumaki Hinata, née Hyūga (日向)) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. Formerly the heiress of the Hyūga clan, she lost the position upon being deemed unsuited for the responsibilities of leading the clan.	Konoha, Konoha
Nonetheless, Hinata persevered and from her observation of Naruto Uzumaki especially, Hinata found an example to follow. Through her membership with Team 8, she sought to become strong enough to change herself, if even a little at a time.	Naruto
A few years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata joined the Uzumaki clan after marrying Naruto. Hinata and Hanabi fight for the heiress position.	Naruto, Shinobi
Hinata is the oldest daughter of Hiashi Hyūga. When she was still a child, Hinata was almost kidnapped by the-then Head Ninja of Kumogakure, who was visiting Konoha under the guise of signing a peace treaty between their two villages.	Konoha, Konoha, Ninja
"Hiashi killed him and saved Hinata, setting in motion the events that would become known as the ""Hyūga Affair"". [9]
 Because Hiashi was the head of the Hyūga clan, Hinata was raised to be its heiress and her family expected great things from her."	other
But even at a young age, her father came to believe that Hinata was not suited for the role of heiress, as she struggled under his gruesome training regime, on top of him also believing that her timid personality prevented her from truly excelling. When Hinata's younger sister Hanabi started displaying superior talent, Hiashi began to reconsider Hinata's selection as heiress.	other
In the anime, Hinata and Hanabi were pitted against each other to determine who would one day lead the Hyūga. Because Hinata was unwilling to harm Hanabi - a hesitation Hanabi did not share - she was defeated, disappointing her father.	other
"[10] Hinata was then disinherited and turned over to the care of Kurenai Yūhi. [11]
 Hinata meets Naruto."	Naruto
On the day of her enrolment in Konoha's Academy,[12] Hinata was picked on by three bullies because of her unusual eyes. Naruto, despite not knowing her, immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged the red scarf he was wearing.	Naruto, Konoha, Konoha
When he regained consciousness, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. Hinata started watching Naruto from that point onwards, and by doing so saw Naruto's desire to gain attention and his struggle to exceed the extremely low expectations others had for him.	Naruto
Despite this, Naruto never lost faith in himself or his dream to become the Hokage. Hinata was inspired by this and started emulating Naruto, adopting his refusal to never give up as a means of earning her father's approval.	Naruto, Kage
"In the anime, Hinata's growing affections for Naruto were noticed by the Hyūga's elders, who warned her to stay away from him. [13]
 As a child, Hinata was soft-spoken and polite, always addressing people with proper honourifics."	Naruto
She is kind, always thinking of others more than for herself, caring for their feelings and well-being. She doesn't like being confrontational for any reason.	other
This led to her being meek or timid to others, as her overwhelming kindness can render her unable to respond or act for fear of offending somebody. [14] Her father's constant push to alter this personality trait when she was younger only made it worse, eroding Hinata's self-confidence and making her even more bashful because she gained so little faith in herself and opinions.	other
"[3] Despite being disinherited, Hinata loves her family very much, as shown when she ""agreed"" to marry Toneri in order to rescue Hanabi even though she knew it meant breaking Naruto's heart and the possibility she and Toneri actually would get married. Hinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8."	Naruto
Whereas her father and much of the Hyūga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything,[15] her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable.	other
"It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it. [16]
 Hinata dreams of being with Naruto."	Naruto
Hinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father.	Naruto
[17] But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself.	Naruto
Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting his nindō of never giving up to improve herself.	Naruto
To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village. [18] By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened.	other
"[19]
 Hinata's intimidating demeanour. Throughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faced Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning."	Naruto
[20] She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up. [21] Two years after the war, upon achieving her greatest dream of having her love reciprocated by Naruto to form a deep and committed relationship together, she became more expressive about her feelings.	Naruto
In the anime, she is able to laugh openly because of it. [22] After marrying Naruto and he becomes Hokage, Hinata remains supportive of him and his increased responsibilities, even though she yearns for him to be home more often.	Naruto, Kage
As a mother and wife, she has become a master homemaker, keeping the family well-structured yet well-adjusted and happy. While very loving and supportive of her family, she is equally strict and assertive.	other
Her newfound structured nature made her very intimidating and more easily angered when her family acts up, easily keeping them in line and swiftly punishing them for their misconduct. [23][8] She is also insightful and wise with her words, realising that her children, particularly Boruto, take after Naruto in the desire to prove themselves to others and that she must believe in them to do things on their own.	Naruto, Boruto
"[24]
 Hinata is a slender girl of fair-complexion who, as a Hyūga, her most distinguishing trait is the Byakugan, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a bob-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; in The Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair extends beyond her hips and she would at times tie it into a ponytail."	Naruto, Byakugan, Movie
By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders. [25] She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto[12] and Toneri Ōtsutsuki.	Naruto, Boruto
In Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps her forehead protector loosely around her neck.	other
In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black.	other
Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantry flak jacket and assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector. Two years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a form-fitting light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist and short dark navy shorts.	Konoha, Shinobi, Konoha
She also wore thigh-high stockings with black, open-toed boots. She does not wear her forehead protector at all.	other
Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a wide black and grey top with a long grey sash around her waist.	other
She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings.	other
During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with a two pink coloured strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots.	Naruto
In the Boruto manga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it. She also wears her wedding ring on her left hand and has her hair cut into a short bob style with fringes covering the top of her forehead.	Boruto
Hinata repelling a Ten-Tails mini-clone with the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. Originally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir.	Ten-tail
[26] After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character. [27][20][18] Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised by Hamura Ōtsutsuki as the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of the Tenseigan, even though she herself can't destroy it.	Naruto, Byakugan
"[7]
 Over a decade later, while rusty as she retired to be a housewife, Hinata's prowess still remained formidable. Despite being unprepared and reluctant to fight Hanabi, an active jōnin who continues training to become the next Hyūga clan leader, Hinata decisively defeated her sister in a match."	other
"[28]
 Hinata's Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist using Hamura's chakra. From her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra."	Chakra
In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I resulted in her ability to free herself from contraints[29] and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them into projectiles. [30] By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.	other
When she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of his chakra because she is a member of the Hyūga clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attracts Toneri Ōtsutsuki.	Chakra
It is also because of her being the member of the Hyūga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, though she can't destroy it by herself, so instead she held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone without the Hyūga and Ōtsutsuki bloodline can't touch it. Hinata's Byakugan.	Naruto, Byakugan
As a Hyūga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, a dōjutsu that grants her penetrative vision in a near-360° around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra. [31] With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Chūnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri.	Byakugan
Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own. [32] She can also use it in order to identify genjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area.	Byakugan, Arc
[33] In the anime, Hinata can use infrared vision and magnify in to see tiny targets. [34] By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.	Chakra, Byakugan
"[35]
 As is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in the Gentle Fist fighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals' chakra pathway systems and the 361 tenketsu that run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact."	Chakra, Byakugan
"[15] Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place. [36]
 Hinata and Neji combining their Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palms."	other
While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created the Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms as an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms. [37] By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques.	Chakra
During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use the Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use the Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm to attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,[38] which increases in power if used in conjunction with others.	Chakra, Shinobi
[39] She also mastered the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms in the war. [40] By the time she reaches adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist.	other
[41] As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu. [42][43] Hinata is also proven to be very resilient, having survived an assault by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki.	other
While Hinata doesn't usually use ninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, her nature transformations included Fire and Lightning Release. [4] In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency in medical ninjutsu, able to use the Mystical Palm Technique to heal the wounded.	Shinobi

 Main article: Prologue — Land of Waves
In the anime, while the graduates of her Academy class are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team as Naruto Uzumaki. To her disappointment, she is instead added to Kurenai Yūhi's Team 8, along with Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame."	Naruto
"Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father, Hiashi Hyūga, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of the Hyūga clan. [15]
 Main article: Chūnin Exams
 Hinata lets Naruto copy her test."	Naruto
Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in the Chūnin Exams being held in Konoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test.	Naruto, Konoha, Konoha
The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper.	Naruto
He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat.	Naruto
Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter the Forest of Death with the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start.	Naruto
Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner, Akamaru, senses the Three Sand Siblings' fight with Team Shigure.	other
Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified when Gaara mercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest.	other
After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba.	Naruto
When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of the Hyūga Clan Secret Ointment so that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin, Neji Hyūga.	Naruto
She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hyūga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja.	Ninja
She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says. Hinata fights Neji.	other
Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her.	Naruto
Hinata and Neji exchange Gentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed her tenketsu at the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks.	other
Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her. Hinata is saved from Neji.	Naruto
Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. When Hayate Gekkō is about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet.	Naruto
Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observing jōnin.	other
Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team of medical-nin to be given emergency medical attention.	Naruto
After a month, on the day of the Chūnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at the Third Training Ground.	other
Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him.	Naruto
Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that.	other
"Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as ""weird"" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away."	Naruto
Hinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again.	Naruto
Kiba gets an Anbu (Kabuto Yakushi) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.	Naruto

After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house.	Shinobi

When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the Fifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War.	Kage, Shinobi, Arc
She was later invited to Yakiniku Q to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.	Naruto

Their entire division is sent to intercept a large segment of the White Zetsu Army, which Neji and Hinata join forces in attacking after Kitsuchi unearths the Zetsu army. Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition.	other
After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.	Naruto, Byakugan

When Naruto reaches the Second Division's location he starts identifying and defeating the disguised Zetsus, including three that attempt to attack Hinata. Although Neji is suspicious that Naruto may also be a White Zetsu, Hinata insists it's the real Naruto, which she can tell by looking in his eyes.	Naruto
Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him.	Naruto

Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him.	Naruto, Shinobi, Ten-tail
Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from.	Naruto, Ten-tail
Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own.	Naruto
He then dies from his injuries. Naruto shares Kurama's chakra with Hinata.	Naruto, Chakra
Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die.	Naruto
Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up.	Naruto
Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.	Naruto, Chakra, Ten-tail
As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha.	Naruto, Ten-tail
The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him.

Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke.	Naruto, Sasuke, Ten-tail
But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.

Although she completes the scarf, Hinata struggles to bring herself to give it to him, and it is only at the encouragement of Sakura and Hanabi that Hinata finally approaches Naruto. Once she finds him at Ramen Ichiraku, Hinata is intimidated, first by Naruto's many other female admirers, and then by the fact that he is already wearing a scarf that he clearly cherishes.	Naruto, Sakura
Assuming she lost her chance to be with him, Hinata runs off. As she cries over the scarf alone, she is approached by Toneri Ōtsutsuki, who requests to be given the scarf instead.	other

In place of Hinata, Toneri is successfully able to kidnap Hanabi. Hinata requests to be added to the team sent to rescue her.	other
After leaving Konoha, Hinata is able to find Hanabi's trail using her Byakugan, which leads them to an underground passage. Shortly after entering the passageway, the team is trapped in a genjutsu that dredges up old memories.	Byakugan, Konoha, Konoha
While Hinata relives moments from her past that relate to Naruto, the scarf - which she's in the process of repairing - gets loose from her bag and wraps around Naruto, sharing her memories and corresponding feelings with him. Sakura is able to release them from the genjutsu and they start to continue ahead.	Naruto, Sakura
Hinata is held back by Toneri, who expresses his desire to marry her. He explains that he has taken Hanabi's Byakugan for himself in order to carry out Hamura Ōtsutsuki's decree to destroy the Earth, after which he can create a new world with Hinata's help.	Byakugan
Hinata refuses to cooperate and vows to save Hanabi on her own, to which Toneri observes that she doesn't know where Hanabi is. Naruto interrupts them and defeats Toneri, who turns out to only be another puppet.	Naruto
Toneri tells Hinata that he'll return later for her answer. Naruto and Hinata reunite with the rest of the team and exit the underground passage, arriving in what they later discover is the Moon's interior.	Naruto
They split up to explore the surrounding landscape, with Naruto spending more time with Hinata. He now displays a greater interest in her thoughts and well-being, pleasing Hinata and giving her greater resolve to complete the scarf.	Naruto
As she is about to confide in him what Toneri told her, the rest of the team locates them and asks Hinata to look at a crypt they've found. There, Hinata is confronted by another member of the Ōtsutsuki clan, who shows her visions of how to stop Toneri and who introduces her to Hamura himself, who asks her to save the Earth.	other
Naruto tells Hinata he loves her. Hinata does not share her visions with the others and starts diligently trying to complete the scarf.	Naruto
When they make camp later that night, Naruto confronts Hinata and assures her they will save Hanabi. He also tells her that he loves her, leaving her speechless.	Naruto
Rather, when Toneri comes for Hinata's answer, she gives the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. When Naruto asks Hinata if it's a lie that she will marry Toneri, she reluctantly does not deny it.	Naruto
Upon seeing Naruto being hit by Toneri's attack, Toneri immediately put her to sleep. After she wakes up in Toneri's castle, Hinata checks on Hanabi to make sure she's alright and locates the Tenseigan that Toneri is using to control the Moon's movements against the Earth.	Naruto
She spends her time making yet another scarf, and when she has a chance she slips away to try to destroy the Tenseigan. She is found by Toneri's puppets and Toneri himself detains her.	other
Hinata tries to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen. After which Toneri destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control.	Naruto
"After being placed inside a picture frame, Hinata shed a tear over her regret about ""betraying"" Naruto. Hinata is forced to go through with a wedding ceremony, but as Toneri is about to kiss Hinata, Naruto interrupts the wedding."	Naruto
After Toneri leaves with her, Naruto is able to release her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologises to him for her earlier behaviour, though he states he already understands and forgives her. Toneri becomes distracted by his own awakening Tenseigan, allowing Hinata to escape with Naruto to the primary Tenseigan's location.	Naruto
Because she possesses Hamura's chakra, only Hinata is able to destroy it. However, she lacks the raw strength to do so, and must instead channel her chakra into Naruto so that they can destroy it together.	Naruto, Chakra
With the Tenseigan gone, the Moon's movements stop and the puppets that the rest of the team is elsewhere fighting are rendered inert. The team reunites with them, bringing along a rescued Hanabi and the remains of Hinata's scarf.	other
Even though it's in tatters, Naruto asks if he can have it anyway, which Hinata happily complies with. Naruto and Hinata share their first kiss.	Naruto
Toneri uses his own awakened Tenseigan to resume the Moon's movement towards the Earth. He then attacks them and captures Hinata, forcing her to watch as he tries to kill Naruto.	Naruto
Naruto ends up defeating him instead and Hinata, once freed, takes back Hanabi's eyes. Toneri tries to make one final attack and Naruto and Hinata prepare to face him together, but Toneri is knocked into space by the statue.	Naruto
Naruto saves him and Toneri gives up, allowing Hinata to tell him Hamura's true wishes: to protect the Earth, not to destroy it. Toneri is repentant and remains behind when they head home, vowing not to let the Moon endanger the Earth again.	Naruto
As they return through the same passage they used before, Hinata asks Naruto about the scarf he's been wearing. He tells her it was a gift from his mother, causing her embarrassment that she would be jealous.	Naruto
Upon hearing Naruto say that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, Hinata sheds tears of joy. As the passageway disintegrates behind them, Naruto propels himself and Hinata back to the Earth, where they share their first kiss.	Naruto

After Boruto left, Hinata talked more with Shino, apologising for the trouble Boruto was causing, noting that he wanted her husband's attention to the point where, like his father, Boruto wants to make a name for himself.

While preparing for dinner with Naruto, she wished that Boruto and Kawaki could join them, asking Naruto how long their mission could take. Having left the house, Kawaki joined them, wishing to talk to Naruto.	Naruto, Boruto
Kawaki told them how much Naruto meant to him, and how far he was willing to go to get rid of all Ōtsutsuki, Boruto included. Hinata was hurt by it and slapped Kawaki.	Naruto, Boruto
He conceded he might be insane for what he was willing to do, and sent them away with a rift to stop them from interfering, willing to bear their hate and welcoming them to kill him when he was done. Naruto and Hinata were kept in Daikokuten, suspended in time, unable to think, age, and requiring no air or sustenance.	Naruto

Although they do manage to find Naruto and Sakura, they are attacked by Hiruko's henchmen; the members of Team 8 end up fighting Ni and her chimera-dogs."	Naruto, Konoha, Sakura, Konoha, Arc, Movie
Although they defeat her, Ni fuses with her teammates, Ichi and San, into a massive flying beast. As the rest of the Konoha 11 distracts the beast, Hinata and Neji use their Gentle Fist to destroy it.	Konoha, Konoha

Hinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 fight off an attack by what seems to be the entire Akatsuki roster, but what are actually disguised parts of the White Zetsu Army. When Naruto and Sakura are sent to the Genjutsu World, they meet that world's Hinata: she is dressed provocatively and is more assertive and confident in herself."	Naruto, Konoha, Akatsuki, Sakura, Konoha, Movie, Ninja
"She is aggressively infatuated with the Genjutsu World's Naruto, to the point of threatening any girl who is with him; Sakura becomes frightened by Hinata's threat to kill her for ""flirting"" with Naruto. Hinata Hyūga is a playable character in the following video games:
 In later instalments of the Clash of Ninja series, Hinata is playable in an ""awakened"" form."	Naruto, Sakura, Ninja
In this form, her clothes are similar to what she wore during the Bikōchū Search Mission, though the form itself is not based on the events of that arc. Awakened Hinata has a personality similar to Neji's during the Chūnin Exams, arrogantly challenging opponents and boasting about the power of the main branch of the Hyūga clan.	Arc
While in this form, she is also able to use techniques such as Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms and Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven. Most Clash of Ninja games require that this awakened Hinata be selected separately, but in Clash of Ninja Revolution 3, normal Hinata can transform into her in the middle of battle by activating her Byakugan.	Byakugan, Ninja
"A similar form appears in Ultimate Ninja 2, dubbed ""Byakugan Hinata"", with the main difference being she wears the traditional Hyūga attire. In several of the Ultimate Ninja Storm games, the team combination of Hinata and Naruto is titled ""Secret Lovers"" or ""Joined Hands""."	Naruto, Byakugan, Ninja
Hinata is featured in the online game, Fortnite, in her Part II outfit as a playable skin.	other
