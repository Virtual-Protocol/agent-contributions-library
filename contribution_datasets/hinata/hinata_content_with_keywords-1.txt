A powerful fox known as the
Nine-Tails
attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage,

The
Third Hokage
returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again	naruto, manga, hokage, mythology, confucianism, shinobi, konoha, ninja
Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him	naruto, hokage, konoha, ninja
Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher,

After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams	naruto, chunin, exam, rank, ninja, sakura, kakashi
During the exams,
Orochimaru

Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The
Akatsuki
starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts	naruto, konoha, sakura
Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the nine Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except
Gaara
, who is now the Kazekage	ninja
Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder
Tobi
that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared	konoha, orochimaru
Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader,
Nagato
, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.
With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as
Madara Uchiha
(one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve
world peace
	naruto, konoha, madara, nagato
The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied
Shinobi
Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of
zombie-like
ninjas	shinobi, ninja
The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with
Killer Bee
, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.
During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead	naruto, obito, kakashi
The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans	naruto, konoha, sakura, obito, madara
However, Madara's body ends up possessed by
Kaguya Otsutsuki
, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her	obito, madara, kaguya
Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system	madara, kaguya
Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes	naruto, hokage, kakashi
Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries
Hinata Hyuga
and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the
next generation

Production
Development
In 1995, Shueisha released
Karakuri
, a one-shot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the
Hop Step Award
in 1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow-up, and decided to work on another project.
[
2
]
The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print	naruto, manga, hokage, kishimoto, karakuri, kakashi, hyuga
Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of
Naruto
for the summer 1997 issue of
Akamaru Jump
based on the idea.
[
3
]
[
4
]
Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.
[
5
]
The first eight chapters of
Naruto
were planned before it appeared in
Weekly Shōnen Jump
, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time
Naruto
debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters.
[
5
]
Though Kishimoto had concerns that
chakra
(the energy source used by the ninjas in
Naruto
) made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read.
[
6
]
Kishimoto is a fan of
Godzilla
, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters.
[
7
]
He has said that the central theme in
Part I
of
Naruto
is how people accept each other, citing Naruto's development across the series as an example.
[
8
]
For Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid "overdo[ing] the typical manga-style".
[
9
]
He considers that his drawing style has changed from "the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic."
[
9
]
Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha's search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes	naruto, manga, mythology, konoha, kishimoto, chakra
As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes.
[

]
Characters
Main article:
List of
Naruto
characters
When he created
Naruto
, Kishimoto looked to other
shōnen
manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture.
[
11
]
The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another.
[
12
]
He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in
Part II of the manga
, beginning with volume 28.
[
8
]
He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences.
[
13
]
As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the
ellipsis
in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.
[
14
]
Setting
Kishimoto made use of the
Chinese zodiac
tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this.
[
6
]
When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the
Naruto
manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha	naruto, manga, konoha, kishimoto
The idea of the setting came to him "pretty spontaneously without much thought", but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of
Okayama
. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores.
[
15
]
He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.
[
15
]
[
16
]
Conclusion
Masashi Kishimoto's home was close to
Hiroshima
where his grandfather lived	kishimoto
He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges. In retrospect, Kishimoto commented he could not criticize anyone as a result of the war based on it was built.
[
clarification needed
]
Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided to create world war story arc for the manga's finale	manga, kishimoto
However, unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in
Naruto
a more hopeful feeling.
[
17
]
Nagato's arc paved the way for the ending of
Naruto
to occur. Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto's mentor Jiraiya	naruto, kishimoto, nagato
Understanding the fears of war, Naruto's characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War. These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle.
[
14
]
Due to unknown issues, the series' finale was delayed	naruto, shinobi, nagato
Once volume 66 was released, Kishimoto commented he reached a moment from the narrative involving something he always wanted to draw.
[
18
]
When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke. However, the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war.
[
19
]
Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship.
[
20
]
When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines.
[
21
]
[
22
]
but decided to leave Naruto's maturation through romance as an idea for the film 2014
The Last: Naruto the Movie
where he worked alongside screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka, a writer more skilled at the theme of romance.
[
23
]
Similarly, the title character's relationship with his first son,
Boruto
, was explored furthermore in the 2015 film
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
to end Naruto's growth as the character had become an adult, but it was briefly shown in the manga's finale.

Critical response
Several reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A	manga
E. Sparrow of
IGN
and Casey Brienza of
Anime News Network
felt that the result was a strong storyline,
[
123
]
[
124
]
but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for the same website, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot.
[
125
]
Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves
[
125
]
which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action.
[
125
]
Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as "dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling".
[

Briana Lawrence from
Mania Entertainment
describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel.
[

Writing for
IGN
, Ramsey Isler called
Jutsu
one of the most entertaining concepts in
Naruto
, stating as well that their diversity, complex signs required for techniques, the unique physical features, and the sheer destructive power of
Ninjutsu
are the elements that have made the series widely popular.
[
128
]
In a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II's storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality.
[
123
]
The fights across the Part II received praise, most notably Naruto's and Sasuke's, resulting in major changes into their character arcs.

Meanwhile, the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two's personalities were shown in the aftermath	naruto, manga, kishimoto, anime, jutsu
Some writers criticized Kaguya being the least entertaining villain, making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result. The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both
Anime News Network
and
Comic Book Bin
, with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character.

Responding to

success, Kishimoto said in
Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008
that he was "very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja	naruto, ninja, kaguya, kishimoto, anime
It shows that the American audience has good taste [...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them."

Gō Itō, a professor in the manga department of
Tokyo Polytechnic University
, compared the series' development to the manga of
Dragon Ball
, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters' martial arts very well. Gō felt readers could empathize with the characters in
Naruto
via their inner monologue during battles.
[
136
]
The series also influenced the movie
Scott Pilgrim vs	naruto, manga
The World
with director
Edgar Wright
saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a "killer move" in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique's usage.
[
137

When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto's work.
[

The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are, something game developer

Themes
Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to
Japanese mythology
in
Naruto
is intended to add further layers to the story. Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations	naruto, manga, mythology, kishimoto
One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities:
Tsukiyomi
,
Amaterasu
, and
Susano-o
. Plumb also cites Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an
uchiwa
	ninja, uchiwa
These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to "blow away" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto. Foxes (
kitsune tsuki
) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories, they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays.

Christopher A	naruto, mythology
Born notes that the
Naruto
storyline contains traditional
Confucian
values, and suggests that students who analyse manga such as
Naruto
and
Bleach
will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas.
[
153
]
Norman Melchor Robles Jr. evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in
Naruto
by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values; he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent, but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence.
[
154
]
Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of "traditional ethical values"	naruto, manga, confucianism
She also compares the treatment of
alienation
in
Naruto
, which Naruto overcomes by joining his society, to the portrayal of alienation in
Akira
and
Neon Genesis Evangelion
, where the main characters remain alienated.
[
155
]
Naruto
has been described by several critics as a
coming-of-age story
.
[

[

Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series.
[
156
]
In
Yukari Fujimoto
's view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as
One Piece
and
Air Gear
.
[
157
]
Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: "Naruto's strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge".
[
158
]
Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins.
Shōnen Jump
began to carry comedies such as
Gintama
and
Reborn!
from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis:
Naruto
"was not supposed to provide laughter anymore".
[
159
]
Fujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles, noting "[...] its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation"	naruto, manga
For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but "once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace". Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto	naruto, ninja, sakura
Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in
Naruto
, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not	naruto, ninja, sakura
Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.

The

The

If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens."
