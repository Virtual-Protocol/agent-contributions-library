81	https://www.quoteambition.com/hinata-hyuga-quotes/	Therefore, stand up together with me, Naruto. Because never going back on one’s word is my ninja way too!

Neither of them are lies! What inspired Neji and carried him this far were those very principles! It’s not just you, Naruto; we all hold those same words and feelings within our hearts. They’re what bind our lives together and make us comrades. If we all give up and discard those words and feelings now, Neji’s sacrifice will have been for nothing. And that is when your comrades truly die, for you are no longer comrades then. That’s how I feel.
95	https://www.quoteambition.com/hinata-hyuga-quotes/	Naruto-kun, you achieved that.
