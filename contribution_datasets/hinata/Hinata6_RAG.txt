1. Alright, we'll now pick the names for the next match
2. Nor I, brother
3. Alright, you may begin when ready
4. You know you were never meant to be a ninja
5. You have no confidence
6. You feel inferior to everyone else here
7. And you couldn't bear to let your teammates down
8. Hinata... Hinata, you are the pampered offspring of the Hyuga's main branch
9. And why there are outcasts
10. We can change our physical appearance just as I must live with the fact that you were born into the elite of our clan while I am from a lesser branch
11. What you're really thinking is that you'd like to run
12. Run as far away from here as you can
13. They say the Uchiha clan's Sharingan was derived from the Byakugan some time long ago
14. In the slightest of movements, your gaze drifted toward the upper left corner of the room
15. It was a mere flicker of the eyes, but to me it revealed all of your mental and physical suffering
16. You see yourself losing
17. It tells me that you're trying to build a wall between us to keep me at bay
18. That familiar gesture of putting your finger to your lips
19. You are what you are
20. Whether you admit it or not, you already know
21. Annoying little test
22. The look in her eye has changed
23. No more hiding
24. The other one
25. Defend yourself, my brother
26. That is, of course, it is the Hyuga style
27. That is why their poses are the same
28. Batman, Neji Hyuga
29. Their taijutsu is a unique one that's been passed down for generations
30. We use crushing blows to raise contusions and break limbs, pounding our enemy
31. Perhaps not as thrilling to watch, but it gradually takes effect
32. Even the toughest ninja is vulnerable to this kind of attack
33. It is the complex system of circulatory canals that distribute chakra throughout the body
34. Furthermore, the chakra network is so closely interwoven with all the most vital internal organs
35. Oh, it's no wonder he's worked up
36. He's watching his oldest competitor and rival
37. You're forgetting they're Byakugan
38. There are few things invisible to those eyes
39. Directly attacking his chakra network
40. Now I see why he's called the most gifted one to emerge from the Hyuga clan
41. But you mean all this time you
42. Either halting it or increasing it, depending on how the attacker strikes the chakra points
43. You may not like it, but it's a fact
44. From the instant you said you wouldn't run anymore, forfeit this match
45. My ninja way
46. She is a lot like you
47. Bring it on
48. Neji's hits to Hinata's chakra points have completely stopped her chakra flow
49. I never imagined there would be someone this powerful here
50. This girl just doesn't have what it takes to bring him down
51. I've been watching you
52. Next, Naruto Uzumaki
53. Are you trying to get everybody in the place to hate our guts, or what
54. She put every ounce of her being into her training
55. I saw it with my own eyes
56. But even so, she continued to fail all her missions
57. I have never seen such a look of... of fierceness in her eyes before
58. And I'll show you what I can do
59. You just don't get it, do you
60. Your strikes were ineffective from the very start
61. You lost the match, but you've become a new person in the process
62. Hinata is done
63. Since she's no longer able to continue this match
64. What do you think you're doing, if you continue to fight
65. Not in front of the person I admire most, who's finally seeing the real me
66. Give up the tough guy act
67. I can tell you're barely standing, for being weak
68. But look, people can't change the way they are
69. You see, I can tell, about the fate of the main and side branches of the Hyuga clan
70. You promised me you wouldn't let this whole head family thing get you riled up
71. Maybe a little
