She is the Hyuga family's clan leader and the strongest Hyuga member. She started to train under her father, but soon he realized that she was not very strong-minded	family, clan
Many Hyuga members thought of her as a weakling, but that was not the case. Since her childhood, Hinata has been very sensitive and careful about everything	childhood
She has a shy personality and doesn’t want to hurt anyone, which restricts her moves to be more defensive whenever she fights someone. After seeing her personality and strength, Hiashi Hyuga arranged a match between Hinata and her younger sister Hanabi Hyuga 	personality, sister
During that fight, her father saw that Hinata was hesitating to fight or hurt Hanabi, making him reconsider his choice for the next clan leader. Hinata was handed over to Kurenai Sarutobi , a sensei in the academy, from the Sarutobi Clan 	academy, clan
The day Hinata got enrolled in the Academy, she was cornered by three kids who started to bully her because of her eyes. Naruto saw Hinata getting bullied and came to rescue her	academy
Even though he was weak against them, he still showed his courage. He told those three boys that he would be the Hokage one day, but sadly, he got beaten up by them	hokage
However, they left Hinata alone, and that’s how Hinata’s love story with Naruto started. The Chunin's exam made Hinata stronger when she saw Naruto fighting with all he got, and she got inspired by his words- “I never give up.” She fought with Neji Hyuga in the Chunin exam, and after that, on the brink of defeat, Naruto cheered her on	love, chunin, exam
She then took Naruto’s motto and said that she would never give up from now on; from then on, she just got stronger. In the fight between Naruto and Pain , when Naruto gets caught by Pain and is about to get killed, Hinata comes forward to save him despite knowing that she is no match for Pain	motto

Personality Hinata is considered a fan favorite female character in the Naruto series. When she was a child, she used to be very shy and soft-spoken, and very few times did she even say anything	personality, series, character
She is so kind that she never wants to hit anyone, which is an issue during training because, in the academy, students do one-on-one fights to improve their movements. When she saw Naruto in the Chunin Exam and saw how tough and brave he was, even though everyone thought he was weakling, she decided to follow Naruto Ninja's way: never give up	academy, ninja, ninja, training, chunin, exam
From then on, her personality started to change when she had a duel or any mission. Even though Hinata was getting stronger, her shyness never went away	personality, mission
Whenever she saw Naruto, she got so nervous that she sometimes fainted, like when Naruto came back after 2 years of training with Jiraya sensei, one of the Legendary Sannin and a grandfather figure of Naruto. During Pain's fight , she shows courage and duels with him one-on-one to save Naruto from Pain	training
She says, ‘I can die for you, Naruto, because I love you.’ She contributed well during the 4th Ninja War and showed courage to save Naruto from Madara and Obito.
