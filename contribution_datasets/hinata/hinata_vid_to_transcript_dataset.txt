1. Remember the mission I gave to get wedding gifts
2. Do I really have to assess every one of them
3. Well, I guess that it all worked out
4. Now they can be the ones given assignments on the day of the wedding
5. Hinata, it's been a while, hasn't it
6. How are your wedding plans going anyway
7. I take it Naruto's doing well
8. I'm hoping to take a quick nap
9. I'm sorry to have bothered you
10. Is all the prep for the wedding done
11. Well, most of it
12. But actually, more than Naruto, it's my father who keeps telling me what I should do
13. Even for us, like how Kakashi-sensei gave us- Hey
14. Uh, he's just going through a lot trying to wrap up all the missions before the wedding, that's all
15. Well, I guess so
16. What's Naruto doing anyway
17. We hardly ever get to see him anymore these days
18. We just completed a mission ourselves, and I'm sure that it's gonna make you happy
19. And we're looking forward to the wedding
20. Oh, thank you
21. Everyone's acting really weird around me lately
22. No, it's true
23. I'm not lying
24. Come on, stop
25. I mean, it's not my fault
26. Most of the shinobi in the village will want to attend Naruto and Hinata's wedding ceremony
27. Plus, there are gonna be a lot of VIPs attending
28. It'll be crucial to have enough security for the event
29. What does that mean
30. Are we just gonna have to draw lots or something like that to see who can go to the wedding
31. I didn't think that our wedding would cause so much trouble
32. I don't think there's gonna be any need
33. I'll take on the dirty work, and that'll be that
34. If Team 8 isn't there, Hinata's gonna be really sad
35. I'm so sorry
36. You haven't decided who can attend our wedding, right
37. You found out
38. I would never want to put anyone through trouble just to celebrate our wedding day
39. But about the security
40. Can't we have the Hyuga Clan handle the missions and guard duty that day
41. As Hokage, I have to make sure your whole family can be there for you
42. So for now, just focus on yourselves, that's all
43. We all know about Naruto and Hinata's wedding, and that we can't all be there
44. Everyone here will handle the assignments that day
45. We'll schedule the missions and guard duty, and we'll all just work in shifts
46. Thank you all
47. I'll think of something
48. Well, well, if it isn't Hinata
49. What's the matter
50. Did Naruto do something he did, didn't he
51. I knew it
52. Please forgive Naruto
53. Please, I'm begging you
54. I didn't even tell you anything
55. But you decided that Naruto must have done something wrong
56. It didn't even cross my mind that having a wedding would cause so much trouble for so many people
57. After all, Naruto's a hero who connects every village
58. You're wrong about that, Hinata
59. Naruto will always be Naruto
60. Naruto's become someone that connects everyone in every village together
61. Thank you so much, Irohka
62. I know what the solution is now
63. Come on now
64. I need to record your message or I won't have a wedding gift
65. Well then, Konohamaru, I think it's time you got to work
66. In short, would it be possible for you to dispatch some hidden sanshinobi for the day of the wedding
67. Uraikage, Tsuchikage, Mizukage and I have talked about what we can do
68. This is all possible because of the peaceful bonds that were forged through Naruto's strength
69. Actually, may I be so bold as to ask for one more favor
70. Oh, a video message, huh
71. Gara, say something
72. Oh, come on
73. What Kazekage can't come up with a proper bu-
74. Do you remember that congratulatory message that you recorded me delivering before
75. Come on now, don't say that
76. Can't you just use that one for your video
77. But you held out for so long, and now you're the only one who hasn't finished theirs
78. I can't believe it's almost here
79. Naruto's wedding is next week
80. I'm pretty sure he's gonna be taking care of that
81. Is something the matter
82. You haven't been around much at all lately
83. I'll stop by again in just a little while
84. Please say hello to your dad for me
85. Alright, can you jump this far
86. That night, you acknowledged me
87. Do you remember
88. Your words changed me
89. I was just thinking about you, and so I thought that I'd stop by here to, you know, see if you were still alive
90. What happened to you
91. It's really nothing at all
92. Just some stuff
93. But more importantly, what about you
94. You really should hurry up and find someone to get married to, Iruka-sensei
95. Oh, shut up
96. You heard me
97. My single days are numbered
98. I gotta have all the fun I can till... You stupid fool
99. It seems there are a lot of things I failed to teach you about how to be a good human being
100. Where are we going, Iruka-sensei
101. Please, if Hinata's around, I can't tell you what I wanted to say
102. You know, have a little fun
103. Do you think that you might be willing to take on the role of my father at the wedding
104. I'll see you later, Iruka-sensei
105. Are you wrestling with some kind of problem again
106. A large miso char siu ramen, topped with naruto fish cake, please
107. How are all of the preparations coming along
108. Oh, you've accepted Naruto's request to attend as his father, haven't you
109. There's no doubt that you're Naruto's teacher, Iruka-sensei
110. Thing is, I kind of feel like this shouldn't be coming from the point of view of a teacher to his student
111. I hope that you'll continue to support him just as you always have, Father
112. I don't get it
113. What is this
114. It isn't very much, but please put it toward the cost of the wedding
115. I'm not going to take it either
116. Listen, please, don't worry about that
117. I wish that I could have done something fatherly to help you out more, though
118. So in a way, you are acting like the father of the groom
119. You think so
120. Naruto and Hinata, congratulations on your wedding
121. yeah congrats congratulations on getting married stop by once in a while for ramen
122. okay big brother naruto you did it
123. and i'll do my best too naruto hinata congratulations on your wedding naruto hinata congrats on your wedding naruto i just have this to say you'd better do everything to make hinata happy
124. What a joyous day this is
125. This training especially so
126. You have way too much joy in your heads
127. And we're gonna tell Naruto all about the history of the Senju clan along with this
128. What are you doing, Mirai
129. But Akamaru looks a little tired now, so why don't you just come on down from there
130. We'll go Shino back right again
131. Just what are you smiling about
132. Who ever said that I was smiling
133. That's not it
134. Man, this is such a drag
135. Come on, let's go over there
136. Did you know they were like that
137. Hey, what's the matter, Iruka-sensei
138. Is there something that's still worrying you
139. Everyone's here today, all because of Naruto
140. Well, I never really got around to preparing my toast for the reception
141. Big Brother Neji
142. I'm about to get married
143. You look so beautiful
144. Don't you think so, Father
