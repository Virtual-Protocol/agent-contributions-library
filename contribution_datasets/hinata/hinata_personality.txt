20	Unlike most of the other characters at the start of the series, she was one of the few characters (along with Iruka, Kakashi, Shikamaru, etc.)
21	that actually cared about Naruto , and not treat him like a monster.
22	Her designs are great and very cute.
23	While she isn't really a fighter, she still puts up a good fight whenever she does battle.
24	Like Tsunade , Konan, Chiyo, etc., she is one of the few well-written female characters in the series.
25	Even though she is rather kindhearted and tender, she does have some really scary moments, most notably in the Boruto series.
26	By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control of her chakra has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.
27	During the Chunin Exams, she allowed Naruto to cheat on her test, however he declined.
28	During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba.
29	After said fight, she gave some healing ointment to both Naruto and Kiba so their wounds can heal faster.
30	While she was badly injured and almost killed after her fight with Neji, she still put up a great fight against him, and it showed us that she isn't the useless type of girl.
31	She, along with Sakura, Ino, Kiba, Izumo and a few others were some of the few people to cheer for Naruto during his fight against Neji.
32	During a filler arc, she went off by herself and trained by a waterfall in order to create a new jutsu, which later turned out to be the 8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
33	Before Naruto returned to the village from training, during a second Chunin Exams, she became a Chunin along with her team.
34	In the Pain's Assault arc, when Naruto was impaled and pinned down by Pain's chakra rods, rendering him immobile, she attempted to protect him while fighting Pain, knowing that she doesn't stand a chance and might die fighting Pain, but just wanted to protect Naruto when no one else did and puts her life on the line.
35	The scene where she confesses her feelings to Naruto is one of the most emotional/heartwarming moments in the series due to how much she loves Naruto and is willing to sacrifice herself to protect him.
36	Although she gets overpowered and defeated by Pain, this act from Hinata would pave the way of Naruto's victory over Pain.
37	During the Fourth Great Shinobi War, after Neji collapsed from exhaustion, she took responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan
38	When Neji sacrificed his life to protect Naruto and Hinata from the Ten-Tailed Beast, Obito taunts Naruto with his speech that if he keeps resisting, all of his friends will share the same fate as Neji, making Naruto nearly lost all hope and join Obito to stop further bloodshed, but Hinata prevented Naruto from joining Obito and encourages him to not give up and to not let Neji's death be in vain, which motivates Naruto to continue fighting and share his chakra with everyone.
39	With her Byakugan, she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchuriki, and informed Sakura and the Alliance about it.
40	During the Last, she decided to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the damaged one he gave her when they were children.
41	Later in the movie, she gave the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri.
42	While this seemed like she was marrying him, it turned out to be a plan to get closer to Hanabi, who has been kidnapped by him.
43	Later on, she tried to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen.
44	Then, Hinata attempts to destroy the Tenseigan Altar as per Hamura’s request only to be stopped by Toneri, after which he destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control.
45	After being placed inside a picture frame, she shed a tear over her regret about ""betraying"" Naruto.
46	When Naruto released her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologized to him for her earlier behavior, though he states he already understands and forgives her.
47	In Boruto, she became a great mother, heck, she almost sacrificed herself to save Naruto when he was kidnapped by Momoshiki.
48	Her act of fainting when she sees Naruto can be repetitive to some people.
49	Her Road to Ninja Genjutsu world counterpart is just unbearable.
50	Although she did it do in order to save Hanabi, it was foolish of Hinata to leave with Toneri, breaking Naruto's heart in the process and tried unsuccessfully to reason with Toneri, who responds by destroying her scarf and brainwashing her.
51	Also, the scene where Toneri possesses Hinata can be heartbreaking to some people.
52	She shares a birthday (December 27) with Ochaco Uraraka from the popular anime/manga series My Hero Academia .
53	Coincidently, both characters has have a crush on the main protagonists ( Naruto / Deku ) of their respective series, and both aspire to be just like them.
54	Hinata Hyuga is a Naruto anime series character who belongs to the mightiest Hyuga clan of Hidden Leaf.
55	She is a fan favorite female character in the Naruto series.
56	Hinata Hyuga is a Kunoichi of Hidden Leaf village (Konohagakure) and a former heiress of the Hyuga clan.
57	Still, because she is not meant to be the leader of one of the strongest clans in the Naruto series, she has been dropped to be the leader of the clan and carry them to another generation.
58	She was very nervous and had no motivation to be a great shinobi.
59	Still, after meeting Naruto Uzumaki over the course of her childhood, seeing him perform, and not going back on his words, and even though everyone calls him a weakling, she decided to follow his ninja way.
60	From then on, she started to grow stronger and stronger, and now she is one of the strongest Kunoichi in the Hidden Leaf village with the great power of Byakugun , a dojutsu that allows a user to see 360 degrees and also the chakra points.
61	She has been in love with Naruto since childhood when he saved her from some bullies who were making fun of her eyes.
62	As a Byakugan user, their eyes are more unusual than the rest of the others.
63	Byakugan eyes are not like Sharingan eyes which go back to normal when they are not using the power, and all Hyuga clan members have the same kind of eyes.
64	Hinata and Naruto married at the end of the series and even have one movie, The Last: Naruto the Movie , where they both confess their love to each other.
65	Hinata is from the Hyuga clan, a Byakugan user and the oldest daughter of Hiashi Hyuga.
66	She is the Hyuga family's clan leader and the strongest Hyuga member.
67	She started to train under her father, but soon he realized that she was not very strong-minded.
68	Many Hyuga members thought of her as a weakling, but that was not the case.
69	Since her childhood, Hinata has been very sensitive and careful about everything.
70	She has a shy personality and doesn’t want to hurt anyone, which restricts her moves to be more defensive whenever she fights someone.
71	After seeing her personality and strength, Hiashi Hyuga arranged a match between Hinata and her younger sister Hanabi Hyuga .
72	During that fight, her father saw that Hinata was hesitating to fight or hurt Hanabi, making him reconsider his choice for the next clan leader.
73	Hinata was handed over to Kurenai Sarutobi , a sensei in the academy, from the Sarutobi Clan .
74	The day Hinata got enrolled in the Academy, she was cornered by three kids who started to bully her because of her eyes.
75	Naruto saw Hinata getting bullied and came to rescue her.
76	Even though he was weak against them, he still showed his courage.
77	He told those three boys that he would be the Hokage one day, but sadly, he got beaten up by them.
78	However, they left Hinata alone, and that’s how Hinata’s love story with Naruto started.
79	The Chunin's exam made Hinata stronger when she saw Naruto fighting with all he got, and she got inspired by his words- “I never give up.” She fought with Neji Hyuga in the Chunin exam, and after that, on the brink of defeat, Naruto cheered her on.
80	She then took Naruto’s motto and said that she would never give up from now on; from then on, she just got stronger.
81	In the fight between Naruto and Pain , when Naruto gets caught by Pain and is about to get killed, Hinata comes forward to save him despite knowing that she is no match for Pain.
82	She still goes to save Naruto, and that’s what happened; Pain killed her, triggering Naruto to change into his Nine-tailed beast form.
83	Hinata played an important role in the 4th ninja war when she was able to keep Naruto's mind together as he fell into depression because of the death of his comrades.
84	Obito 's words caused him to lose his spirit to fight against him, and when he was ready to join Obito, Hinata slapped her and reminded him of his vow.
85	In Boruto , Hinata is a perfect wife and mother, and to be that, she left her ninja missions and became a full-time housewife so that she could take care of her children and Naruto, who is the Hokage of the village.
86	Hinata is considered a fan favorite female character in the Naruto series.
87	When she was a child, she used to be very shy and soft-spoken, and very few times did she even say anything.
88	She is so kind that she never wants to hit anyone, which is an issue during training because, in the academy, students do one-on-one fights to improve their movements.
89	When she saw Naruto in the Chunin Exam and saw how tough and brave he was, even though everyone thought he was weakling, she decided to follow Naruto Ninja's way: never give up.
90	From then on, her personality started to change when she had a duel or any mission.
91	Even though Hinata was getting stronger, her shyness never went away.
92	Whenever she saw Naruto, she got so nervous that she sometimes fainted, like when Naruto came back after 2 years of training with Jiraya sensei, one of the Legendary Sannin and a grandfather figure of Naruto.
93	During Pain's fight , she shows courage and duels with him one-on-one to save Naruto from Pain.
94	She says, ‘I can die for you, Naruto, because I love you.’
95	She contributed well during the 4th Ninja War and showed courage to save Naruto from Madara and Obito.
96	After she became the mother and wife of Naruto, she became a real woman and started to be more confident and strict with her kids, Boruto and Himawari.
97	That is one of the huge changes Hinata has in Boruto.
98	Hinata, in childhood, has short purple hair, which we saw during the movie and in some Naruto episodes where she remembers her childhood.
99	In Naruto Part 1, Hinata's purple hair grows a bit more, but the hairstyle is still the same.

104	She changes her attire when she has to go on a mission.
105	She wears the sleeveless lavender full top with shorts and high stockings covering her legs.
106	In the movie ‘The Last,’ Hinata wore a few different outfits.
107	At the start, she was wearing her normal purple jacket.
108	During a mission to find Hanabi, she wore her mission outfit.
109	In a few scenes, like when she was about to marry Toneri Otsutsuki, she wears a black gown which many girls wear during a wedding.
110	In the end, we see that when she marries Naruto, she wears her white dress, a Hyuga clan dress for the bride.
111	In Boruto, she Mostly wears a light purple jacket and green shorts with black high-top shoes or sandals and a shoulder-length haircut.
112	Hinata has grown into a strong Shinobi with many Jutsu and fight styles under her arsenal.
113	Hinata is part of the Hyuga clan, so she possesses a special eye power called the Byakugan, which gives her the power to see the chakra points of any person.
114	She can also see 360 degrees around herself with her Byakugun, and her eyes can see around 20 kilometers through anything, but if only there were no jamming jutsu.
115	As a Byakugan user, she can see the Chakra point, and with her taijutsu, she can block the chakra flow in any person's body.
116	Hyuga also has a wind nature style, and with the help of wind and her Byakugan power, they can use Trigram Vacuum Palms, which can blow away anything in its range.
117	She has great Chakra control and can perform healing jutsu, which is not as great as Sakura, Shizune, or Tsunade, but she can heal small wounds.
118	She also can use a Four Corners Sealing Barrier, which can seal a tailed beast.
119	This technique can only be performed by the main house of the Hyuga Clan, and this advanced Juken method is also classified as a hidden technique.
120	Hinata releases a tremendous amount of chakra as shrouds shaped like guardian lions.
121	Along with its terrible force, this jutsu may be coupled with Hakke Rokujuuyon Sho to drain enemies' chakra.
122	After the Land of the Sky attacks Konoha , Naruto, Hinata, and Sakura are tasked with escorting Amaru and Shinn back to their village.
123	When they get to the village, it has been destroyed, and Amaru sets off a booby trap out of distress.
124	Amaru is saved by Shinn, who appears to be mortally injured and dies, as Hinata's Byakugun verifies.
125	When the group split off to explore the region, Hinata was arrested and put in jail along with the other villagers.
126	Later, Amaru locates them, sets them free, and takes them to safety.
127	Hinata and the other members of the Konoha 11 repel an assault by what appears to be the whole Akatsuki cast but are a group of the White Zetsu Army in disguise.
128	When Naruto and Sakura are taken to the Genjutsu World, they see Hinata; she is more forceful, self-assured, and dressed provocatively.
129	"Sakura is horrified by Hinata's vow to murder her for ""flirting"" with Naruto since she is smitten by him in the Genjutsu World, and she threatens every girl with him."
130	A crew, including Hinata, is dispatched to the Blood Prison to save Naruto, who was unjustly detained there.
131	She worries when he gets impaled and is relieved when Ryzetsu saves him.
132	Hinata is a member of a team assembled by Hamura's ancestors who had sealed them to Konoha as they look for the supposedly lost ninja Kakashi.
133	Despite finding Naruto and Sakura, Hiruko's goons assault them, and Team 8 members ultimately have to battle Ni and her chimera dogs.
134	Even though they succeed in defeating her, Ni joins forces with colleagues Ichi and San to form a huge flying beast.
135	Hinata and Neji utilize their Gentle Fist to kill the beast as the other members of the Konoha 11 divert its attention.
136	The Konoha 11 are forced to combine their efforts against the beast due to Hiruko's repairs, and Hinata and Neji's contribution is the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms.
137	Every Naruto fan waited for this movie since they wanted to see Naruto and Hinata fall in love; this is one of the main reasons for this movie.
138	The moon that Hagoromo Otsutsuki had long ago built to enclose Kaguya Otsutsuki's body starts to descend toward Earth two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War's events.
139	Naruto must cope with this new danger since the moon is now a meteor that will vaporize everything upon impact.
140	Toneri Otsutsuki, a Hamura Otsutsuki descendant who is obstinately eager to carry on his ancestor's heritage, is to blame for the situation.
141	Hinata wants to give Naruto a special present of affection during the Konohagakure Winter Festival—a crimson scarf she crocheted herself in memory of the one he wore in the Academy.
142	Sakura offers to assist.
143	After failing to capture Hinata and causing damage to the scarf she had crafted, Toneri then infiltrated Konoha and abducted Hanabi Hyuga.
144	Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Sai , and Shikamaru go to save Hanabi after being sent on a mission.
145	Shikamaru is also handed a unique clock that is only owned by the five Kage and appears to be counting down to the end of the world.
146	Naruto eventually understood the idea of love while traveling through the village's ruins and going through Hinata's memories.
147	Toneri eventually steals Hanabi's Byakugun and inserts them into his vacant eye sockets, reawakening the Tenseigan that Hamura's ancestors had sealed during the previous millennia.
148	After being severely beaten by Toneri, he also succeeds in asking Hinata to marry him, and she acts self-assured, which sends Naruto into a profound melancholy.
149	While Naruto is away, Sasuke returns to Konoha to defend the town from meteors that have broken off the moon.
150	Many Naruto fans may not know about this, but every fan should read this as it is about Naruto and Hinata's dating life and shows where they went out on dates and how it happened.
