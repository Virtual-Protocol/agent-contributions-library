Hackers steal nearly $10 million from Axie Infinity cofounders personal accounts One of the cofounders of the video game Axie Infinity and the related Ronin Network had nearly $10 million in cryptocurrency stolen from personal accounts Reports said wallets belonging to Jeff Jihoz Zirlin were hacked to the tune of 3248 ethereum coins or about $97 million Zirlin confirmed on social media late Thursday that two of his accounts were compromised The attack is limited to my personal accounts and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain or Axie Infinity operator Sky Mavis Zirlin said	Ethereum Crypto, General
Another Ronin Network cofounder Aleksander Larsen echoed those comments Its unclear how the intruders got access to Zirlins wallets The Ronin Network underpins Axie Infinity which has a playtoearn economy based on ethereum Its particularly popular in Southeast Asia	Ethereum Crypto, General
Hackers stole $600 million in cryptocurrency from the system in March 2022  an attack that US prosecutors subsequently attributed to Lazarus Group a North Korean statebacked cybercrime operation On Friday analysts traced the funds stolen from Zirlins accounts to activity on Tornado Cash a mixer designed to hide the source of cryptocurrency	Crypto, General
Lazarus used the mixer to launder funds from the 2022 hack according to the US government which separately sanctioned Tornado Cash Blockchain investigator PeckShield told the publication Cointelegraph that the theft was indeed a wallet compromise I want to assure everyone that we have strict security measures in place for all chain related activities for Ronin Zirlin said This has been a tough morning for me Two of my addresses have been compromised The attack is limited to my personal accounts and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain Additionally the leaked keys have nothing to do with Sky Mavis operations	Ethereum, Crypto, General
Dont engage with it as the owners have a record of manipulation and failure P2E News recently shared a Twitter poll asking followers to vote for the best Web3 gaming ecosystem It appears that the poll was shared without any ulterior motive on any specific entity	Ethereum, Crypto, General
However Jihoz subsequently retweeted the post advising his followers not to engage with P2E News since according to him its owners have a record of manipulation and failure It seems that Jihoz believed that P2E News was still under the management of Corey Jihozs retweet included the caption This account is run by the team behind a failed horse racing game	Ethereum
Dont engage with it as the owners have a record of manipulation and failure Corey quickly responded to Jihozs tweet questioning why he never say things to him in person such as at Philippine Web3 Festival where the two were present You tripping ser Why you never say things to me when we are in person at the same events Very silent about your opinions until youre online Havent owned this page in a year and unfortunately we havent failed at @PegaxyOfficial as much as youd like to think so but keep emphasized that he hasnt owned P2E News in a year He also defended Pegaxy stating that they have not failed as much as Jihoz claimed	Ethereum, Crypto
Corey challenged Jihoz to specify the manipulation he was referring to and questioned the progress of Jihozs goal to reach 1 million followers But why did Jihoz suddenly attack Corey and Pegaxy First its important to know why everybody is shocked about Jihozs behavior against Corey According to Corey Jihoz was in the line behind him at dinner (during the Philippine Web3 Fest) and even went to their afterparty (Gathering of the Greats at Xylo bar in BGC) Jihoz was also seen replying to Coreys tweet in 2022 which gave the community the impression that the two were positively interacting and building in the Web3 space Look at this Jihoz and Corey interacting and trying to build No drama	Ethereum, Crypto
No hype No punching down Its always the blind followers So why is Jihoz suddenly throwing shades against Corey No one knows the exact answer	Ethereum
However lets analyze the possibilities of what could have triggered Jihoz to post such a tweet First Jihoz may have been offended by the meme posted by Corey on Twitter which replaced Jihozs face with Coreys in a popular picture saying 2022 WELL SHOCK THE WORLD (AGAIN) It was captioned Who made this Who made this  pictwittercom/cAMlncDfFJ  Corey Wilton  (@RealCoreyWilton) April 24 2023 The picture was originally Jihozs face with the quote from his tweet from January 1 2022 How do you think theyll shock the world this year Jihozs tweet stating that they will shock the world again in 2022 Second P2E News tweet about Axie Infinity The price of Axie Infinity land has taken a tumble but is it still a good investment opportunity As earlier mentioned Jihoz was under the impression that P2E News was still owned by Corey which has since been proven to be untrue	Ethereum, General
Its possible that Jihoz interpreted the above tweet as a harsh critique against Axie Infinity when in fact it was simply a post aiming to get community opinions Hours later after Jihozs controversial statement Corey posted a tweet saying that he just want to build Mirai Labs with his team in peace Mirai Labs is the studio behind Pegaxy and other developing games Just want to build @TheMiraiLabs with our team in peace  I do love my #1 fan though @Jihoz_Axie Meanwhile the web3 gaming community shared their thoughts about the feud between Jihoz and Corey	Ethereum, Crypto, General
Many were surprised by Jihozs sudden outburst against Corey and Pegaxy as he had never shown such behavior before	Ethereum, Crypto
