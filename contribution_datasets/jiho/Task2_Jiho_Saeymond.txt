1	Find Axie Infinity in our Top Blockchain TCG Games list. What is Axie Infinity Axie Infinity is a creature collection and battling game, we use blockchain technology to really 	empower our players and allow them to earn crypto despite playing the game	axie, crypto, blockchain, technology
2	We also seek to be the first game that’s really owned by its community. So we just released a governance token called AXS to achieve that goal		axs, community, token
3	Axie Infinity is the number one NFT project in terms of traction and community right now. A lot of investors are looking into Axie infinity	axie, nft, community, project
4	And yeah, Axie Infinity is fun. There’s a very engaging kind of collection and economic aspect to it, which lends itself to really deep analysis	axie
5	Recently, you partnered with Chainlink. In the official announcement, you mentioned the integration of price feeds for ETH/USD		eth, chainlink
5	Why integrate a decentralized feed, rather than centralized prices? Inside Axie Infinity With Jihoz - Growth Lead 32 We’re doing two things with Chainlink . One, we integrated 	decentralized price fees for the ETH/USD price on our marketplace, which makes sure that the price feed is accurate and never doubted		eth, axie, jihoz, decentralized, 	chainlink
7	If we were taking it from centralized websites, the price could go down, and, that could impact the service. This is also good especially for newcomers who might not be familiar 	with ETH prices		eth
8	The second thing that we’re doing is that we’re integrating the Chainlink VRF that ensures when there’s some kind of random element or event related to chance, then you make sure 	that that act of rolling is fair. Take for example origin Axies		chainlink
9	Those axes can only be created from a special token that’s leftover from the beginning of the game. So you can think of them as kind of like the unknown Opened first edition 	booster packs from Pokemon	token
10	There’s still a chance of opening an origin Axie and some of them could have mystic parts, which are rare. The cheapest is around six or seven ETH right now	eth, axie
11	A triple mystic Axie just sold for 300 ETH. That property is very important, and it needs to be as transparent as possible	eth, axie
12	How’s the development of the game going so far? In terms of the gameplay, you know, so far, we’ve really focused on battling the axes. So we built the initial battles with them 	that was kind of like browser based auto battles	gameplay
13	In terms of gameplay, we’re working on two things, a land system. So this idea of Axies you know, being able to be placed on top of land harvest resources, craft, and build 	different structures, and harvest tokens	gameplay
14	Smooth and faster-paced gameplay. Project L, the Axie Infinity Secret Project	axie, gameplay, project
15	We also have a secret project. That is also gameplay related		gameplay, project
16	We’ll just leave that as a little bit of a surprise. That’s project L		project
17	What are some other things Axie is working on? On top of gameplay. We’re also obviously working on a lot of other things like Ronin, which is our Ethereum based side-chain, a 	wallet for Ronin, marketplace upgrades, as well as a staking dashboard and try the community Treasury		axie, ronin, gameplay, community, ethereum
18	How many people work for Axie Infinity? We have around 25 people on the team right now. And we’re looking to expand pretty aggressively		axie
19	The next question is about Ronin. Why do you develop your own sidechain? Couldn’t you use an already established solution? We have a history of building, we’re one of the few 	projects that have actually delivered on side-chains or layer two	ronin
20	So we built our land and item marketplace on top of the LOOM network. We saw a lot of the pitfalls of building on top of someone else’s technology requires a lot of back and forth 	and requests for features and things		technology
21	So we believe in taking our destiny into our own hands. That’s why we call it Ronin	ronin
22	Ronin is kind of a samurai without a master in ancient Japan. We prefer to have more control over the developer experience for ourselves	ronin
23	For the Axie universe, they’re great as avatars, and they kind of really make a statement when someone is looking at your account. If you have a mystic Axie, people know you are 	someone important within the Axie ecosystem, or, someone who believes in the vision	axie, ecosystem
24	We also worked with MAKER, with Kyber network and others, introducing them to these DeFi protocols. What we’ve tried to do is work with the best of blockchain projects and that are 	bringing real benefits to users and have been able to scale their communities		blockchain, users
25	You need to have a growth mindset because the problem with these applications is that they don’t have users, When you need to grow or die, everything needs to be worth the growth 	mindset. What about Axie Infinity in underdeveloped countries such as the Philippines or Venezuela? Image courtesy of Coindesk.com The intersection of blockchain and games is 	doing, it will be critical in the rise of digital nations	axie, blockchain, users
26	So these digital nations will have their jobs, markets, complex economies, social structures, and even governments. The Axie community is becoming its own digital nation	axie, community
27	It’s becoming its own country, with jobs through DAOs, a new type of government. Farming these tokens and playing the game is the source of work and labor and the marketplace is 	the economy	farming
28	That’s adding value, into the network and being able to earn some type of token or reward in exchange for that work. The player base from the Philippines and Venezuela increased, 	and even in developed countries in the West, this is becoming a valid source of income for people, and I expect it to increase over time	token
29	So people need to figure out how to how to earn money, just by being on their computer. If you look at it, the people who are leading this revolution, come from some of the poorest 	countries in the world		computer
30	Where do you see blockchain gaming five years from now? I think that blockchain gaming will not just be seen as gains. In five years, people will live work, and play in these 	digital nations		blockchain
31	According to Peckshield , over 3,000 ETH were withdrawn from the game’s Ronin Bridge, which also suffered a loss from compromised keys in 2022. The funds were immediately deposited	into crypto mixing service Tornado Cash		eth, crypto, ronin
32	The attack is limited to my personal accounts, and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain. Additionally, the leaked keys have nothing to do with Sky 	Mavis operations.… — Jihoz.ron 🦌 (@Jihoz_Axie) February 23, 2024 Read more: Explainer: What to know about crypto mixer Tornado Cash Security firm Ancilia’s initial flagging of 	the withdrawals suggested that the bridge itself had an issue 		crypto, jihoz, ronin
33	However, this was quickly refuted by Axie and Ronin’s COO, who added, “The bridge itself has top security, been through many audits, and goes on pause when too much is being 	withdrawn.” Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game that exploded in popularity via the concept of ‘play-to-earn’ during the crypto market’s last bull run. What happened to Ronin 	Bridge? @Ronin_Network https://t.co/Cj1DIBHpom Over 2790 ETH has been withdrawn and deposited to Tornado immediately		eth, axie, crypto, blockchain, ronin, market
34	In March 2022, the Ronin Bridge was hacked for approximately $625 million worth of Ether and USDC. Shortly afterward, the FBI ascribed the losses to the work of the North Korean 	state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus		ronin
35	The bridge was emptied due to a majority of validator keys (five of just nine validators) being compromised. For comparison, Ethereum currently has over 1.2 million validators	ethereum
36	Four of the Ronin validators were run by Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity, with the final validator, which belonged to the Axie DAO, overridden thanks to an agreement 	designed to ease network congestion. This attack was originally detailed in a post-mortem report from the Ronin team, but it has since been deleted	axie, ronin
37	With such a large concentration of funds, blockchain bridges have often proven lucrative targets for crypto hackers, who use an array of social engineering techniques to gain 	access to key infrastructure. In the case of Ronin, the hack was executed through a malicious PDF, which was delivered under the guise of a job offer		crypto, blockchain, 	ronin
