“The energy here in the Philippines is amazing. We all know that Axie and the Philippines are inexplicably linked, we grew up together. The energy from the community is super strong, it’s been a hard time for the crypto (and) web3 space recently but, being honest, being here really allows us to push forward and gain that strength that we need,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“Now (we have) thousands of really strong supporters, community members, cheering us on. It’s amazing, it’s a totally different feeling and it gives me a lot of hope for the future,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“weren’t sure about the COVID restrictions in Manila”|https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“But of course, future big events like that in the Philippines will definitely make a lot of sense,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“I am incredibly proud of the team… we’ve been waiting for this moment for 3, 4 years because we always knew that the Philippines would be the center of blockchain gaming, metaverse, and web3. It’s only a matter of time before the rest of the world will see that as well,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“there is nothing like seeing your competition face-to-face”|https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“Now, we are the ones where the people are coming into. We are now the ones where the world is going to visit, challenge, and compete against. And that is just a great feeling,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“I don’t think the market cycle really matters as much. I think what matters is if the game is ready, if the community is ready, if the industry is ready. I think it does not matter so much what the prices are. It’s great nga that we can continue to enjoy events like this even (though) crypto prices are not great as they were before.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“I want to shout out the Philippines, the entire week has been so emotional to me. It really feels surreal to see how strong our community is here. You see the numbers, you see the headlines, you watch the documentary, but everyone in the Axie Community needs to know how intense the hype is here. These have been hard times for crypto, hard times for web3, hard times for Axie but coming here gives us the strength to understand what we’re building for, who we’re building for, where we’re going; we need to keep pushing.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
In the recently concluded YGG Web3 Games Summit, a web3 gaming-focused event with a two-day conference, a three-day expo, a two-day tournament, a 24-hour hackathon, and dozens of both pre-event activities and side events, Jeffrey Zirlin, also known as Jihoz, the co-founder of Sky Mavis, talked in front of the Filipino community and discussed the things that are happening in the Ronin Network, the game’s own blockchain, and what has to with these updates in the Philippines’ gaming ecosystem. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“It feels really special. Thank you to Gabby for inviting me, getting this really special group of people together. Being here really feels like being in my hometown. There’s so much love for the Axie and Ronin Nation,” the co-founder said. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
Pixels is a free-to-play blockchain game that lets its players create their own virtual world and earn crypto as a reward for being digital farmers. In September, Sky Mavis confirmed that the game has migrated to Ronin Network to benefit from lower gas fees, go-to-market and advisory support from the developer’s team members. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“All right. So let’s talk about what’s happening with Ronin what’s happening with Axie and also how that has to do? What that has to do with the Philippines, and I promise that I come bearing gifts I come with leaks.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
According to Zirlin, the game saw a 2,500% increase in daily active users since its migration to the Ronin Network. The game also witnessed a total of 417,000 $RON, the blockchain’s native token, spendings from its players for VIP passes. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“That’s over $350,000. So it shows that there’s real demand here and the Pixels team is actually cash flow positive. Sustainability is so important especially during a hard time like this that we’re coming out of,” the game developer explained. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
But what the co-founder highlighted was that “there are so many Filipinos playing this game” and they are not bots: https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“In the last day, 82,000 Filipinos have played Pixels, I’m was looking directly at the Google Analytics data. So for all of the doubters, these are real people, these are Filipinos.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
This is where he emphasized that as the hype in web3 gaming again rises, the Philippines still emerges as the center of enthusiasm.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“So Ronin is back. The Philippines is back. And it’s clear that as we enter a new cycle, the Philippines will remain the beating heart of web3 gaming,” stressed Zirlin. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
During his presentation, Zirlin emphasized that what their team is aiming for is to create an interconnected experience and system of progression between the games that involve Axies, the in-game NFT characters. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“And a core foundation of Axie is the ability to upgrade your Axie, to evolve your Axie. When I think about my childhood, I think about my relationship with Charmander. Actually, the thing that got me so addicted to Pokemon was I really needed to level up my Charmander to Charmeleon to Charizard,” he added. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“That’s actually what got me into it—that same experience, that same emotion is really needed in the Axie universe. It’s actually to be honest. The thing that we didn’t have last cycle. That was the hole in the ship that prevented us from reaching the grand line.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
Moreover, the new update is also part of boosting the comeback of Axie Infinity: Classic, the version of the game that boomed during its hype in the country, as part evolution involves AXP and this token can now be earned by playing the Classic version. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
AXPs, or Axie Experience Points, are off-chain tokens that are used to upgrade an Axie’s body part. It can be gained by playing Axie-related games in the Ronin ecosystem. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
In August 2022, SLP rewards were removed in ‌Classic gameplay in light of the game’s gameplay transition to Axie Infinity: Origins. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
The Classic version became inactive since then, because no more rewards can be earned. But now, Sky Mavis has introduced the integration of AXP and AXS into it, Zirlin called it the “Michael Jordan” moment. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“You know when Michael Jordan went to go play baseball for a little bit and then he came back (to basketball)? Well today, classic has one thing to say. Classic is back. So basically it isn’t just that classic is back. We’ve actually also added a bit of an expansion pack to the game,” the co-founder explained. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
AXS is the governance token of the game, which can be earned by playing The Cursed Coliseum gameplay. The first players that will have 12 wins on this game mode will earn AXS tokens. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
The Classic version also has a regular Grand Tournament, which gives away Mystic Axies as reward. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“Classic is the game that Filipinos, we really know, that you guys all love it. So this is due to the voice of the community where we saw back in July that there were still around 10,000 people playing classic without any rewards and then so we decided to start up a little bit. We had a small tournament that actually attracted over 40,000 monthly active users. So it really is the voice of the community the data that you produced and the feedback that has inspired this momentum for classic,” Zirlin emphasized. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
Earlier this month, Sky Mavis tapped Grab Rewards as its official merchandise partner. The merch store, which will also be accessible through adds in e-wallet app Grab in Southeast Asia, features figurines, plushies, and apparel. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
“We also have a fulfillment center in the Philippines. So the shipping should be manageable and under control. It’s like we’re really good at making and selling digital things. The physical realm is a new experience for,” Zirlin advertised. https://bitpinas.com/feature/ph-beating-heart-web3-gaming/
