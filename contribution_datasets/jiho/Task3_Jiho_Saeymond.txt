1	"So we just released a governance token called AXS to achieve that goal. I see that AXS token is pumping hard. I try not to focus too much on the price. Axie Infinity is the number 	one NFT project in terms of traction and community right now. A lot of investors are looking into Axie infinity"	Crypto, General
2	That’s for two reasons. One is because you guys are doing great work and you are funded as a company	Jiho
3	"There’s a very engaging kind of collection and economic aspect to it, which lends itself to really deep analysis. Recently, you partnered with Chainlink. In the official 	announcement, you mentioned the integration of price feeds for ETH/USD"		Ethereum
4	"Why integrate a decentralized feed, rather than centralized prices? Inside Axie Infinity With Jihoz - Growth Lead 32 We’re doing two things with Chainlink. One, we integrated 	decentralized price fees for the ETH/USD price on our marketplace, which makes sure that the price feed is accurate and never doubted. If we were taking it from centralized 	websites, the price could go down, and, that could impact the service. This is also good especially for newcomers who might not be familiar with ETH prices.
	The second thing that we’re doing is that we’re integrating the Chainlink VRF that ensures when there’s some kind of random element or event related to chance, then you make sure 	that that act of rolling is fair. Take for example origin Axies"	Ethereum, Crypto, General
5	Those axes can only be created from a special token that’s leftover from the beginning of the game. So you can think of them as kind of like the unknown Opened first edition 	booster packs from Pokemon	Crypto
6	"There’s still a chance of opening an origin Axie and some of them could have mystic parts, which are rare. The cheapest is around six or seven ETH right now. A triple mystic Axie 	just sold for 300 ETH"	Ethereum, General
7	"And that’s been, very successful. We currently have around 12,000 daily active users for that. It’s available on Android APK, iOS, test flight, Windows, and Mac"	General
8	"That kind of pushed us into the spotlight and acted as a huge catalyst for increased traction. In terms of gameplay, we’re working on two things, a land system. So this idea of 	Axies you know, being able to be placed on top of land harvest resources, craft, and build different structures, and harvest tokens"	Crypto, General
9	"People are really excited about that. We also have an upgraded, improved battle system that’s under construction as well, with upgraded animations. Smooth and faster-paced 	gameplay. Project L, the Axie Infinity Secret Project. We also have a secret project"		General
10	That is also gameplay related. We’ll just leave that as a little bit of a surprise	General
11	"That’s project L. What are some other things Axie is working on? On top of gameplay. We’re also obviously working on a lot of other things like Ronin, which is our Ethereum based 	side-chain, a wallet for Ronin, marketplace upgrades, as well as a staking dashboard and try the community Treasury. How many people work for Axie Infinity?
	We have around 25 people on the team right now"		Ethereum, Crypto, General
12	"And we’re looking to expand pretty aggressively. The next question is about Ronin. Why do you develop your own sidechain? Couldn’t you use an already established solution?
	We have a history of building, we’re one of the few projects that have actually delivered on side-chains or layer two"	Crypto, General
	So we built our land and item marketplace on top of the LOOM network. We saw a lot of the pitfalls of building on top of someone else’s technology requires a lot of back and forth 	and requests for features and things	General
13	"We prefer to have more control over the developer experience for ourselves. Our initial projection is to roll out early next year. What’s the difference between Origin and Mystic 	axies? Mystic axes are highly collectible limited edition supply capped Axies that are of a special subset of Origin axes"		General
14	"If you have a mystic Axie, people know you are someone important within the Axie ecosystem, or, someone who believes in the vision. Community Question: Axie looks like a closed 	game, many games are doing various collaborations but not you, why is that? A lot of people want us to collaborate with other games, but I don’t think that that’s necessarily the 	best for growth. Because these other games are really small, especially compared to us now, we would rather, you know, interoperate, and work with projects that are much larger 	than us. That’s why we’re big and they’re not"		General

15	"But we are very interoperable at all moments, all Axie Infinity players have used Uniswap because you need to use it to sell your tokens and your small love potions. We also 	worked with MAKER, with Kyber network and others, introducing them to these DeFi protocols. What we’ve tried to do is work with the best of blockchain projects and that are 	bringing real benefits to users and have been able to scale their communities. You need to have a growth mindset because the problem with these applications is that they don’t have 	users, When you need to grow or die, everything needs to be worth the growth mindset. What about Axie Infinity in underdeveloped countries such as the Philippines or Venezuela? The 	intersection of blockchain and games is doing, it will be critical in the rise of digital nations. So these digital nations will have their jobs, markets, complex economies, social 	structures, and even governments. The Axie community is becoming its own digital nation"	Crypto, General
16	"It’s becoming its own country, with jobs through DAOs, a new type of government.
	Farming these tokens and playing the game is the source of work and labor and the marketplace is the economy. That’s adding value, into the network and being able to earn some type 	of token or reward in exchange for that work. The player base from the Philippines and Venezuela increased, and even in developed countries in the West, this is becoming a valid 	source of income for people, and I expect it to increase over time. We’re going through a very difficult time in the world economy, people are losing their jobs"	Crypto, 	General
17	"And with the COVID-19, many jobs are far from being viable. So people need to figure out how to how to earn money, just by being on their computer. 
	If you look at it, the people who are leading this revolution, come from some of the poorest countries in the world"		General
18	"These people are looking for new opportunities. I’m proud that Axie can introduce this concept to the rest of the world. Where do you see blockchain gaming five years from now? I 	think that blockchain gaming will not just be seen as gains"	Crypto, General
19	"(@AnciliaInc) February 23, 2024 Read more: The play-to-earn crypto bubble has popped — Axie Infinity leads, down 99% from ATH In order to avoid costly Ethereum transaction fees, 	which would make the game unplayable, Ronin Network was set up as a cheap sidechain for players’ assets. In March 2022, the Ronin Bridge was hacked for approximately $625 million 	worth of Ether and USDC. Shortly afterward, the FBI ascribed the losses to the work of the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus. The bridge was emptied due to a 	majority of validator keys (five of just nine validators) being compromised"	Ethereum, Crypto, General
20	"For comparison, Ethereum currently has over 1.2 million validators. Four of the Ronin validators were run by Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity, with the final validator, 	which belonged to the Axie DAO, overridden thanks to an agreement designed to ease network congestion. This attack was originally detailed in a post-mortem report from the Ronin 	team, but it has since been deleted. With such a large concentration of funds, blockchain bridges have often proven lucrative targets for crypto hackers, who use an array of social 	engineering techniques to gain access to key infrastructure. In the case of Ronin, the hack was executed through a malicious PDF, which was delivered under the guise of a job 	offer. Jihoz has yet to provide details on how he believes this latest attack took place.

21	We all know that Axie and the Philippines are inexplicably linked, we grew up together. The energy from the community is super strong, it’s been a hard time for the crypto (and) 	web3 space recently but, being honest, being here really allows us to push forward and gain that strength that we need,” Jihoz started when asked about his thoughts about the 	event. PAPA JIHOZ, WEN? Jeff Zirlin of Sky Mavis facing different outlets for an interview, including BitPinas. He also revealed that it is not his first time in the Philippines 	but actually his fourth		Ethereum, Crypto, General
22	According to him, back in the “early days of Axie” he would only speak in front of 10 to 20 people. “Now (we have) thousands of really strong supporters, community members, 	cheering us on. It’s amazing, it’s a totally different feeling and it gives me a lot of hope for the future,” he stated. Meanwhile, with the Philippines having the most Axie 	Infinity players in the world, Jihoz also explained that there was a supposed Philippine-based Axie Con–like the one held in Barcelona last September– but Sky Mavis “weren’t sure 	about the COVID restrictions in Manila” at the time. “But of course, future big events like that in the Philippines will definitely make a lot of sense,” he told BitPinas. On the 	other hand, Buenaventura also expressed his pride and gratitude to all the people behind the fest as well as to those that participated and joined. “I am incredibly proud of the 	team… we’ve been waiting for this moment for 3, 4 years because we always knew that the Philippines would be the center of blockchain gaming, metaverse, and web3	Ethereum, 	Crypto, General
23	You see the numbers, you see the headlines, you watch the documentary, but everyone in the Axie Community needs to know how intense the hype is here. These have been hard times for 	crypto, hard times for web3, hard times for Axie but coming here gives us the strength to understand what we’re building for, who we’re building for, where we’re going; we need to 	keep pushing.”  EMOTIONAL 	Crypto, General

Discussing Ronin, the infrastructure 	powering Axie Infinity, Jihoz revealed that the team had announced the integration of five games from outside the Axie universe. This expansion highlights the potential of Ronin as 	a versatile Web3 gaming infrastructure built by a team experienced in developing and scaling Web3 games.
