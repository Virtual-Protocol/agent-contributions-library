 welcome yeah everyone wants to be a crypto millionaire so uh can you tell us how to do it that's a great question um well I mean first of all I wouldn't say that it's about necessarily becoming a millionaire it's around understanding why web 3 matters and why blockchain in tokens and crypto actually matters in the future and it's really about digital sovereignity and digital ownership your time online is valuable and if you value online time then you will understand the value of crypto so Ju Just reverse engineering netk what you're saying is	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT, Web3
people are online at the moment and they're spending time on platforms we don't need to mention them and those platforms are monetizing them and what you're talking about is spinning that around allowing you to monetize your time and not them corre your time the most valuable resource on Earth today is data right your time online is generating large quantities of this data and actually that doesn't go to you at all in fact you're spending time online and you think you're having fun and enjoying yourself but meanwhile they Farm it and then they create huge	Metaverse
amounts of value from it and they sell it back to you in the form of advertising and marketing and you know basically completely sort of colonizing your time and attention which really you ought to be paid for yeah people need to wake up to this they don't realize that their data is being used and being monetized and they're getting no benefit from it so if people are listening and we've suddenly made them realize that how do they protect themselves how do they monetize their data I mean not everybody will want to necessarily monetize their data but how do they how do they monetize their data in today in in this period of History well I mean I	Metaverse
think the very first thing I would say is that even if it's not about monetizing your data it's about owning your data first right which is the whole sort of principle around building on blockchain when you think about a token for instance the token represents the ownership in the network that you're constructing so let's give an example let's say Instagram right you're posting photos on Instagram you're sharing data actually you're creating a community you're creating a network by creating giving getting a token for instance in Instagram if there was such a thing you become a state holder in the network	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
that is Instagram and every time you contribute value you basically receive a form of tokens which gives you a stake in the network which means as Instagram keeps growing you get a benefit of that growth as well and of course you only get a representation of that growth relative to your contribution that's basically what that does tokens basically are proxies for the network effects inherent in the networks that you help fill but today you don't receive anything uh today for instance when you're basically online you actually get just they just take all the data and they create value and the value	Metaverse
isn't the data itself it's the derivative that the data creates um and and you have no way of tracking that so web 3 and blockchain uh solves that the other thing is you know there's obviously hundreds of millions of people who use Instagram and there's no really good way in which you can normally track ownership let's say of the Instagram Network because you know you can have share registers that have there's no no company in the world that could have 100 million shareholders but you can have 100 million token holders and and these	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
100 million token holders basically are representative of the network and the benefits of that Network and you see this today when you think about ethereum when you think about Bitcoin when you think about you know polygon when you think about all these different type of blockchains they essentially are representations of these networks you which you can have ownership it I want to get into the technicalities in a minute of how each of the I guess cryptos and blockchain systems work so people understand the difference between um the technology and and I guess the brand names like Bitcoin some some SP	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, Atari
there's a brand name now in itself right what is the difference between say Bitcoin and ethereum we talk about a second just before we do are nfts a scam that's what everyone sees to say to me now about nfts what do you think well they're absolutely not a scam in the sense that you know I think they they they represent digital property uh and they actually represent the stores of that particular um so they represent stores of digital culture in the same way that you know we want to store ways of our physical culture often	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT
I give this example of a wedding ring which is something that is in its start something that is the same everywhere around the world but when you actually own that wedding ring that actually becomes something unique to you and that has a cultural identity and a value and essentially becomes unique and therefore non-fungible in nature and that's not necessarily about money it's just about something that speaks to your personal identity I think one of the reasons why people say in the past that nfts are a scam is because when they don't understand what digital property is and what you know the meanings and intention behind it and of course anytime when you have have money involved there are	Metaverse, NFT
people who are going to take advantage of it and this is by the way true in all Industries this isn't related to just what's happening in web 3 or crypto it happens in banking it happens in our areas of Finance it happens in you know like you know Goods like milk and you know milk powder in China like all sorts of scams happen when there are bad people who take advantage of stuff it doesn't matter if it's nft or it doesn't matter if it's basically a financial product for instance or you know shares or whatever it is um I think I think um but when you're not in the space you	Metaverse, NFT
might only focus on the bad things but nfts today forance as an example do about 1.1 to$ 1.2 billion of sales every month um it has changed the lives of millions of people not just in places like the Philippines which have helped sort of include them financially but also artists musicians evening teachers around the world are actually making a better and fairer income through nfts because it really an nft isn't just a digital art or you know some people make fun about the fact that you know it's like these monkey jpex these boor AP and	Metaverse, NFT
it looks kind of funny and weird that's not what you're buying it's actually intellectual property that you're owning and the entire future of a digital world is really intellectual property and how you protect and own that intellectual property rights so I'll give you an example for instance um with dance fight there's dancers out there who get their dance moves ripped off by the largest companies in the world because they're doing a cool dance move on on Tik Tok and then they just use that as a as as a dance move in their game like in fortnite but actually when you take that move and you basically mint it on blockchain you are proving that you the	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
creator of that dance move and in us for instance trademark and copyright laws gives you essentially the copyright um for that which basically means that dance mile belongs to you for instance right and the same could be said for digital art or even teachers around the world who basically minting their learning programs as nfts which then allows other people to buy these nfts to own intellectual property that they've created uh and some teachers have made between you know half a year to a Year's worth of their salary selling FS which	Metaverse, NFT
is a more fair interpretation of the value the intellectual value they're generating than um than today basically earning very low wages I feel like two years ago people were talking about nfts and that's now translated into somehow web 3 which seems um more cool but for people listening that don't understand what web 3 is can you sum it up to understand web 3 let's go and talk about really what web 1 and web two is first right and and why it matters so web 1 you know when we	Metaverse, NFT
were originally started you know in the early days of the internet was a web read and that basically was you know we had a web browser it democratized access to information everyone could basically go online and basically receive news and and and data and that was really the beginning in which we democratized access to that kind of information and had knowledge broadly available to everyone then in web 2 we had the Social Web which allowed people to write to the web which meant that not only could we just consume stuff online we could also contribute to it and everyone became a content creator everyone was able to	Metaverse
post stuff online and that basically created value because it accelerated the access of more information that was compounding on other information and creating value this way but the problem in web tool was in order for it to work you had to write to a database and that database was centralized in nature it belonged to someone whether this was Facebook whether this was Amazon whether this was Google you wrote data to a centralized platform and that data became very powerful and valuable and that data today is powering with things like Google or open AI or all these major systems self-driving cars in which	Metaverse
ping people who have created this value actually have no rights in it and so web 3 is the next answer to this where all of the stuff that you're reading and writing to the web can now be owned by you or by others creating a Marketplace a fair Marketplace for data and also allowing basically to have access in that and so that's why we call Web 3 the web of ownership so it adds it goes you know so web one is read web two is read write and web three is read write and own and the whole point is that when you have ownership you have property rights	Metaverse
and when you have property rights you can have capitalism and all the opportunities that come from owning things at Hell bank we're trying to help people help people and allow people to follow their dreams and get the knowledge they deserve and part fix the education system we want to leverage nfts web free tokens to do that I'm scared of people's misunderstanding of what that might mean but what do you think you know best practice who's doing this well who who's building good	Metaverse, NFT
communities who's who's building good structures around leveraging tokens nfts and community in your opinion well I mean I think first let's talk about what are tokens representative of and what does it mean when you run something on a blockchain essentially on this thing that we call Web 3 first the entire blockchain ecosystem is run on what's known as a consensus mechanism right it's essentially Community agreement so in order to get you know a transaction approved and to validate the transaction	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT, Web3
you need the consensus of the entire network to say yes this was true which to me is more than just a sort of databased system it's kind of a political social system it functions in a decentralized manner meaning that the people around the the network actually have um a say in it and it's not owned by a single party in fact it is decentralized against the entire community so it is literally Community ownership or let's say a network that is community owned whether this is Bitcoin whether this is eum whether this polygon um or whether this	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
is ones that are focused on particular communities for instance something say like open campus which basically is an education uh education um sort of platform that basically is tokenized uh or when you even think about something like a mete like sandbox that's specifically around the world that a Sandbox and people building economic attunes around that centered around the sand token for instance um or for instance for you know apoin which is a similar Community that's focused around ape holders that to me me is no	Metaverse
different than you having a Reddit Community or you having an Instagram following or you having a fan Community you're actually really creating a network of your own but what tokens allow you to do is enumerate the actual value of that Network and then basically being able to sort of sort of uh distribute that value and power to the community that owns that Network like today fans for instance don't own a stake in the network that they've helped create whether you're a football player whether you're a musician whether you're a rock star whether you're Simon right you have a following you have a	Metaverse
community but they don't really have a stake in you and even though they offer a value to your network and tokens basically allowed to do that I think the earliest example of something that's uh that is like that is ethereum but even though ethereum obviously smart contracts a blockchain actually there's a community of tens of thousands of developers that are creating new applications that offer value to the ethereum network and and of itself New Opportunities have being built huge ecosystems have sprung as a result and	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, DeFi
the entire blockchain space today is a two2 trillion space as a result of that so tell us about the size of the market because again I mean I I was reading that there's only 300,000 very active people in crypto which of course is a is probably more the Wales than it is the actual mainstream but how many people are engaging this world and is there a Tipping Point coming because I feel like probably a lot of people listening to this are scared to buy crypto or scared to get involved in in the nft world I mean tell us the size of the market and tell us if you're listening for the first time about this the best way to	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT, Web3
get involved in it and understand it to make your life better later well the entire sort of web three crypto space right now is almost $2 trillion in size um the number of people that own crypto is about 400 million people and growing and maybe the sort of hundreds of thousands of people you mentioned are the whales that are most active in the space but that number is growing I think it's said that something like for instance 22% of all Americans actually own crypto there's another interesting fact which is that the majority of the	Metaverse
crypto is actually held by minority communities so basically asian-americans Latinos why is that well I think um I think a big part of that has to do with Economic Opportunity and access one of the reasons why web 3 is growing the way that it is is that it's the only mechanism in which you can actually have all sorts of people participate in an economic sort of framework that is inclusive right I mean for instance even last year everyone was talking about Ai and open Ai and the opportunities at you	Metaverse
know of the growth of that market who got to benefit from that growth BCS the big companies all those VES that's a really fascinating point so you're you're you're highlighting that crypto almost sounds like a negative word to some people but that whole economy actually helps people get wealth and gain gain wealth that whole movement of web free helps people make money whereas AI in reality still furnishes the 1% Pockets correct correct the the most of what we see in web 2 including we see in most of the AI movement there is also	Metaverse
web3 AI but that's a different topic together uh it doesn't actually allow for the inclusion of the rest of the population they get to use the tools but again they have to pay for it and who receives that value the shareholders and essentially the um the the 1% to one of the big powerful things about web 3 is that it aligns the incentives of the network to create the network so in a traditional sort of corporate setup you have the shareholders investors and you have the builders entrepreneur that receive all the value and then the rest	Metaverse, Web3, Yat Siu
of the ecosystem even though they create value in the network whether it's musici sort of people listening to your music whether there's people participating in the network whether there's people on Instagram or t toop for instance they actually don't receive any value whatsoever except Fame reputation and potentially some business opportunities that come from that so it's it's that attention whereas in web 3 that value is distributed across all of the users meaning that both users and creators in many cases might even receive a larger share of value than the investors	Metaverse
because they all essentially get to participate and I think that also is the reason why um the people are moving to web 3 because they see a way in which the time and effort that they're generating on these networks actually pays them the fair reward that makes it popular I mean think about it if users were not using Instagram today what's the value of Instagram the answer is nothing right so why shouldn't they be paid for that value and the same goes in the gaming industry so many people play games for free they think of it as free entertainment but if those free people	Metaverse, Gaming, Yat Siu, Atari
if free players don't play those games then other people who play the games wouldn't pay for it because there's no way in which you can basically um interact with someone so there is value so we think that your time on Instagram for instance is you're like a free worker shall we say and I think this this this sort of web through web through really really solves that some fact points for instance um you know uh in 22 the total number of nft sales was about $24 billion but what's interesting is not the $24 billion of sales which is of course quite meaningful is the fact	NFT
that 90% plus of that value went to creators and owners of these nfts whereas in that same year Spotify which obviously serves Millions more creators only paid out $8 billion in royalties to its entire Freight Network which was basically um you know serves probably every musician in the world and we all know that people can't make money as a musician on Spotify but they can make money with nfts um and this has a lot to do also with the fact that value is more value distributed it's not so much that	Metaverse, NFT
there wasn't that value there or that's value created out the a it's just the where is a value being distributed in the ecosystem maybe I'll give you one more example in the gaming industry over hundred billion was spent every year on what they call CPI CPA ads to advertise games that's a100 billion that goes to Apple Google Facebook and everyone else on those advertising platforms how much of that money do you think actually goes back into the gaming industry it's happening or not almost nothing nothing right right it goes into all those	Metaverse, Gaming, Yat Siu, Atari
Gamers could promote it probably better than and that's the point apple and all those any and so what happens in a web3 framework in a token economy instead of paying Apple and Google for that they actually play The Gamers and they say hey because you're adding value to the game you're making the game famous or you're marketing the game we're going to give you tokens and reward for that attention and you get the benefit for that not only do we get the right audiences basically because we pay the gamers direct fee the gamers choose to cash out but the chances that they	Metaverse, Web3
reinvested back into your game or another game or participate in the gaming ecosystem is infinitely higher than any of those platforms who have no incentive in the growth of the gaming industry and that's the problem Web Two platforms today are built to be highly extractive and the community themselves doesn't get any of that benefit which means that more and more of that rent has to go to the platform for essentially a companies to succeed in the space but who gets to lose the actual end users they they pay more fees they have to suffer more they get more	Metaverse, Gaming, Yat Siu, Atari
extracted uh and at the end of the day only the platforms win and that's a big problem I translate the way you're saying is like communities that are on platforms end up owning the platform instead of the platform using them to make money correct right so if you're listening to this today and you want to build a business that is taking advantage of this new technology yeah you don't have any money what would you do what would you do if you if you were listening to	Metaverse, Atari
this podcast right now knowing what you know step by step what would you what would you do to help them well the referes thing I would do other than just study the space is Join one of these communities because it's basically almost free to do so I give you one example Community we're involved in which is the apoin Dow and so you talk about Community owned Frameworks these are generally known as decentralized autonomous organizations or Dows as they're known uh which were the community of token holders basically control the treasuries and the value of that ecosystem which they could then use to maybe invest or support a business so	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
let's say someone in your community wants to raise some money for a business or they can go to the apoin down and propose for some funding in a manner that would obviously benefit the community of icoin and today you have companies that make water that make maybe some alcoholic products that make t-shirts or make you know like events um games all funded to the icoin Dow but this Dow is not a VC this Dow is run by the community and has today close to $2 billion of value that they can basically use to invest in these kind of projects	Yat Siu
in fact Dows today have roughly $20 billion of value that could be given to new startups that is entirely owned by the community this is pretty revolutionary because before if you want to raise money you have to go to a VC you have to go to the 1 percentile and ask them for money as opposed to now we can basically go to a community that has control of this we also think that Dows are going to be the future of organizations because they're just better incentive models than you know going for the traditional corporate shareholding model which was you know	Metaverse
the other thing is the corporate model The Limited Corporation was actually an innovation that is really only 30 or 40 years old it's not something that has existed forever right so it was a way in which you could help have more people participate with this kind of limited liability so enters were encouraged to take sort of risk and everything point being though that this corporate structure that we have today is not the final answer to corporate systems it was inter yeah it's it's flawed and it was an in allow Community to own a part like help Bank I'd love it if 12 5,000 people that are on help bank today when	Metaverse, Yat Siu, Atari
recording this could all ow the part of help Bank get into all sorts of legal issues in have that many shareholders that's right ex it's hard to manage also there's structural issues around this but actually when you think about in the framework of a Network Health bank is a network it's a network that helps each other how do you enumerate the value of that Network how can you participate and support the growth of that Network you could do it through a web3 framework like a blockchain or uh with a token infrastructure and that is no different than if you're running something like you know an ethereum as a as a layer one	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
or apoin as a culture token either way it's a way in which you can sort of um create the sort of network value and share that Network value and have people participate in it is it as simple as creating a token and allowing people to have that token is it is it that simple and then it being on a central exchange for it to be traded or no I mean I think there's more complexities around that I mean a lot of people oversimplify this um and think of just issue token there's a lot of things that go into issuing a token uh you obviously need you know the	Metaverse
smart contract you need to audit it you need to also create the utility for it you people understand how you use it and how value can be generated from it for the for the participating Community um there's many things one has to think about but again it is no different I would say than setting up a business and setting about you know a business model and setting um sort of the Frameworks of that business and the mission behind that I think you have to go through exactly the same steps maybe the technology is different or maybe some of the paradigms are different but the end of the day whether this is a company	Metaverse, Atari
whether this is a token it still serves a human purpose and it still serves a goal that is supposed to help people or serve people in one form or the other and therefore I would say the thought process isn't that different but it still involves obviously effort I feel like every single day someone launches some mean coin are they are they following that framework or you know how how does how they seem to be popping up everywhere and that creates a feeling of a scam because they launch they blow up and then they die so meme callings are are I guess one example of what you can	Metaverse
do with tokens but I think of mem coins not necessarily purely as scams although many of them are and they absolutely sort of about buer aware I would say but they are a representation of culture as well right if you someone launches a mem coin it's it's it's part of it is taking the Mickey out of something must say something and then might and it's it's a it's and and I think you know uh when you take a bit from the framework of just having fun and you're just basically experimenting and playing around then really that's how I think the view of mcoin uh I don't think	Metaverse
anyone should be looking at a mcoin as any kind of serious investment and anyone who does I think needs to sort of really reconsider very carefully it's really more about sort of people just having fun and people are just basically sort of doing some silly stuff but of course because of the fact that Capital can form so quickly in web 3 it can generate um basically sort of the situation but you know I would also say any person who actually invests in the mcoin ought to know what they're doing in the sense that you know to well the	Metaverse
point I guess what I'm saying is is that um I think no reasonable person would think that buying a mecoin is a guarantee to success or is an investment product of any any type of sort we certainly don't endorse it but again it's like you know if you go ahead and and and invest in you know all sorts of you know funny online products or if you were to purchase things that if you're like you know like like the back back back back in the old days like the Nigerian scams and so on well I mean you know I think you know what there someone saying there if billions worth of gold they want to send me I'm sure of it	Metaverse
someone was actually sitting there with gold sending out emails I've sent millions of emails no one wants this gold but just be aware right I I guess again I'm just thinking about the people listening to this you know they they see meme coins they see nfts I mean even board Apes which you know you just describe the board Apes scenario board Apes were sold as like this JPEG that Eminem bought for $2 million us that's now only worth 80 oh it's a scam they're missing the point that there a community behind it and it's still there and that community is still there and that Community is still bringing value to the	Metaverse, NFT
world and extracting value right it still exists and there also a way to join the membership of that Community where when you are part of the board a community you actually have access to everyone else in there and there's a respect for that right for instance you know you have a board ape and Snoop Dog has a board ape and you're basically part of that same network there is value with that and when you go to an event for instance like AP Fest you actually get to hang out with those type of it's like a social club in a way it's it's it's a social club and I think is the other thing that I think a lot of people	Metaverse
sometimes sort of don't distinguish around why many people purchase things and like I often give this example between a board ape and a birken bag and you know you don't buy a birken bag because you want to use it to put stuff in it you buy a birken bag because it gives you a kind of social status a social signal that means something to you and I would argue that everything we purchase probably the majority of things we purchase is not for its utility but is for its social signaling and the social signaling by the way doesn't mean that it has to be expensive it just says	Metaverse
something about you for instance if I decide to wear green clothes or black clothes or blue clothes I you know there's a reason behind that maybe it's an identity I like maybe it's an image I like it still something says something about who I am right and so for most people money is a means to a social end we would say meaning that I'm buying this to be a member of this Society whether I want to live in this District whether I want to live in this country whether I want I have this type of car whether I want I have this kind of watch right I mean people don't buy a Rolex toel all the time they they buy it	Metaverse
because again they want to represent some membership or some social status maybe it's just for themselves maybe it's a signal to the world and in web 3 that signal to the world isn't just individual to you and your private Network it gets Amplified to the world because it's online every time a person buys a board ape for instance the entire board ape community and the entire web through Community knows that this happened because it happens on chain whereas in the physical world I might buy a Gucci bag and I will have it and and I like the fact that some other celebrities have it and it makes me feel	Metaverse
good but actually that celebrity doesn't know you bought a Gucci pag or you know some other person around the world that also owns the same Gucci bag doesn't know you own that bag and you've never created that sense of community and so these Network effects compound in web 3 which is a reason why these digital asset in web 3 accelerate because you have these Network effects that Compound on top of each other which you can participate in whereas in web two those Network effects compound the same way except they only compound to the value of the companies that own these Networks	Metaverse
a Hell bank we want to eventually create a token and the reason is that people want to help and this is another way that they can help but also because they like you're saying they want to show that they're helping which I think is actually nothing wrong with it shows that you care about the same things your community what care about yes I think also the charity model is flawed the general charity model is flawed people will give money to something that um that's it the money's gone you give it once and it's gone people want to feel a	Metaverse
sense of investment sustainability within the charity sector so maybe talk from your experience about how you see not only um this technology maybe underpinning charity activity but also um how you think it's going to play out you know in the future of businesses that are built so generally maybe before we even go there how do networks grow and why do you participate in network from a human standpoint it's around social signaling right when you think about why I join Instagram I don't just	Metaverse, Atari
join it for myself I join it to Signal something to either my network or broader Network and expand a network whichever so it's about building your own network effects that have an impact on your social status or your social cing that you want to represent so the same is true when you think about charity and I think one of the flaws of Charity which is the oneway road of I give you money and you build something is that the ability for me to sort of signal that I participated in this charity and I'm supporting it is very hard I might get a sticker I might get a benefit maybe even a certificate and	Metaverse
that's maybe just for me I don't have a way to tell people and I don't have a way of other people the network to know how that network is growing I also can bring attention to the cause that I'm trying to push where in web 3 you can know that at scale and that also means that when I own a token related to that I'm actually sending a message as well if I own for instance if you were to issue a token and it was you know the help Bank token then I'm signaling to the world even if I'm not spending it that I'm a member of help bank and that I'm here to want to help people It also	Yat Siu
says that other people can approach you to say oh you know what you're a help back member that means maybe you're the kind of person same values yeah you have same values that you want to help someone and that's actually also what nfts do if I share in the values of board apes or of Ms or of cool cats or whatever that might be right then actually I will actually own this nft to be part of that Network and immediately other people will share in that and also third parties who you might not know and who may not own this uh this the same token that you do will maybe come and	Metaverse, NFT
offer you benefits and services you know one of the biggest problems in traditional marketing uh on social media is you can't actually Target your customers they say you know you know the irony of about web to advertising is you're supposed to be able to Target your customers good luck doing that right you get a dashboard and you get an approximation of trying to get the audience but you actually don't know that as your audience because it's you know going to 10 million people of which only a fraction might be the people you want but in web 3 you can go directly to the	Metaverse, Telegram
customer whether he owns a board ape he's a certified person who owns a board ape whether he owns maybe the help Bank token that's a certified person who can who proably owns the token therefore is more likely to be wanting to help your cause than just randomly going to 10 million people out in the world who potentially might be interested in this and I think the web two platforms do this intentionally because they want you to spray and pray because they want you to basically waste as much money as possible so their profits are large uh which you know I mean you know they have probably the most cash in the world today larger than than many nations um	Metaverse
so I think I think um the the the way that a token could work here is that owning this token gives a social signaling people can use the token to give to other projects as a way of you know um funding them and every time this I think is a powerful part about web 3 is every time someone else buys a token even just to hold they're creating value for the token they're creating more Network effects which then basically makes your ability as someone who wants to help other companies more powerful	Metaverse
right think about what happened to the ethereum and the Bitcoin network over the last 10 years or so what happened to those networks when people basically held on to them and ended up telling people about it when you have ownership in it you also end up wanting to tell other people about it ownership is one of the most powerful uh sort of human things where you it's not just about promotion it's about being proud about it it's about basically saying hey I'm I'm proud about what Bitcoin represents I'm proud about what ethereum represents and this case you could say I'm proud of what help Bank represents each of the	Crypto, Metaverse
token holders who become a former property owner in in your network then essentially become your agents because they are now a stakeholder in your in your network I hope people listen to this because I think this whole world you're describing right now people don't understand it the majority of people still don't understand its ability to I think create real democracy this is because it's it I mean right now we are sold this concept that we are in control	Crypto, Metaverse
um but we're not really right I mean we don't own our data even if you have a house or mortgage you don't own it the bank does right there's this whole misconception about ownership even your car is if you're on finance isn't yours until you paid off the last payment and so I think how disrupted is the world everyone's talking about AI disrupting everything and I think that web free seems to have gone a bit quiet on this front I think web fre is far more disruptive as far as ownership is concerned yes what what are the companies 10 15 years from now going to	Metaverse
look like someone said to me the other day ethereum is the biggest potential competitor to Amazon oh I I agree with that it's not just the biggest competitor Amazon I think it's so so the thing thing about blockchain is blockchain is a public infrastructure public data infrastructure which has a redundancy and safety of an Amazon and a Goldman Sachs combined and it's available for everyone to use most people might not appreciate just how powerful that is that means someone with an idea to	Crypto, Web3
innovate a financial Revolution or a better data structure or a better safer data structure can now do this without having to build that same infrastructure imagine if you want to build a banking grade data structure you'd have to spend hundreds of millions maybe billions of dollars to do it and here is ethereum that basically offers this exactly same infrastructure basically for the cost of gas you have to program yes and then you get to participate in a network that provides you the same security and the same Frameworks around that that's the reason why you can have digital property	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT
rights now because a network like ethereum provides a secure framework through smart contracts for you to do that without having to replicate that entire infrastructure the other thing about Community ownership that's so important to understand is that even in web 2 nothing is free right I'm using Amazon I'm using um I'm I'm I'm posting something on Instagram it's actually Facebook on the back that's paying the fees or it's Amazon in the back paying the fees so I think or whoever's using the Amazon website service paying the fee so there's nothing that's really	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, DeFi
free but as an end user I think it's free because I'm not paying uh a network fee because the company that's hosting it is paying the network fee but the company that's hosting the network fee is extracting other kinds of value from you in order for them to make it worth it and the point is is that that value is very high whereas in web 3 every person is paying the transaction fee so for instance in ethereum they call that gas every time I make a small transaction to transfer one thing to another to do a transaction to do a purchase I pay a small amount of money	Crypto
in gas and different blockchain have different fees but the point is the cost of that gas insures that the network is operating because it's paid for by the people who maintain the network right so it's basically a community payment system you could say that maintains the sanctity of the network it also ensures that it remains decentralized because no single entity basically can take control of it because it's paid for by the community so it's a Community Network that is paid for by the community sustained by the community which basically no corporate Network can Asser if you wanted to take control of	Crypto, Web3
ethereum you'd have to buy majority of the tokens of ethereum out there that would cost you probably trillions of dollars it's uneconomic right you can't take control of that Network even Facebook and Apple and Google combined wouldn't be able to afford sort of co-opting that Network and that's exactly why we also think of web 3 as a people's movement right it is one that is a people's movement because it's decentralized there was talk at one point if Facebook was going to try and do its own token cor and they couldn't do it because they're centralized right	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
well no so the reason they couldn't do it is uh so that you're talking about Libra yeah and the idea behind that was to create essentially new Financial infrastructure and blockchain Technology around that which tells me very clearly that obviously um Mark zukerberg gets it he understands where the future is going but he was not allowed to do it because governments around the world were like wait a second Facebook has caused enough harm in social media and in web too we need to be careful about what this means when you start issuing his own token in the bom chain and they made it very	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, Telegram, Atari
difficult for him um to basically do that uh and what's happened now is that a number of blockchains that came from Facebook's Labs basically left Facebook and launched their own their own ecosystems and their that's another exciting opportunity I mean you and I old enough to remember the you know the web Revolution yes back in 2000 when it collapsed and everyone said well that people the headline was 1 million people leaving the internet no one cares about the internet any of course it kind of reminds me of that era history repeats itself doesn't it a lot of people have seen that Amazon stock dropped	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
97% people thought that's it no one's going to be buying anything from Amazon the do is over correct it feels like we've just gone through that a little bit with kind of the web free movement where people have speculated on it and then left but slowly is building back up I mean I I see it and in some cases some nft projects I mean I personally made $40,000 on one nft project yeah I've just spent $4,000 buying a mocke which I'd love to talk about in the moment but like is it history repeating itself with this technology and people are missing	Metaverse, NFT, Atari
it well generally speaking what you're seeing is disruption and every time there's disruption and because it's disruption in this capitalist framework we have these volatile Cycles whether this is whether this is mobile whether this is energy it doesn't really matter there are always these cycles that happen and what we saw in web 3 was a similar type of cycle and some of the issues that we had in web 3 as well were some of these scams that took place right whether it was teral Luna whether it was FTX and I think lot of confidence was lost at the time because people thought wait a second if we can't trust	Metaverse
what happened before how do we trust what's going on and of course the amazing thing about blockchain is actually you can verify everything on blockchain it's actually in the most transparent system out there but we didn't have any knowledge as to how to look at that because we're unfamiliar with it and I think the same was with the early days of the internet there was unfamiliarity well people were buying fake Goods on Amazon for example and thinking they were real so correct that didn't mean Amazon was a problem it meant the systems needed to tighten up exactly exactly and you needed where there was Rel exact whether it's regulation whether it's Community Frameworks whether it's other ways in	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
which you know like today for instance you can't really do these sort of you know 401 scams anymore over email because everyone knows that there a scam even though people will try actually it doesn't work anymore because we're we've grown up we're we understand it better I think one of the big challenges about that people have in and the opportunities around web 3 is that people don't understand how Network layers function in web 2 the reason why Network layers are sort of so distributed and so dispar is because you have to Cobble them together for	Metaverse
instance if I want to have a payment system to my website that might operate my game I need to have a data structure for my game I need a data structure for my website I have a data structure for my payment system which means I might have to integrate PayPal into my mySQL database into my Amazon framework whatever that is I have to sort of Cobble systems together which means I'm only really tapping into a small percentage of the network potential because I'm basically cobbling things together on blockchain all of these rails on the same system meaning that	Crypto, Web3
when I sell an nft which is a digital asset I actually do the payment over the same system using the token over blockchain so the payment layer call it a payment system or banking system is shared on the same network as a as as the one that's transferring value selling a good or being a social network and that basically allows for these networks to form and the value that's created from that I think a lot of people don't understand the potential of what happens when you basically create this kind of unfettered access of	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT, Web3
networks that have come together I saw a picture of you standing with Jamie Diamond recently and I love the quote you said in the post does he realize what I do for a living is there a I was also with Tony Blair and that yeah I yeah um I I um I wonder that there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there like jamy Dar will say do not buy crypto and then the business he runs buys crypto mean what what what's actually happening in your opinion well I mean I	Metaverse
think first of all there's a healthy dose of politics that's involved I think as I said earlier blockchain isn't to be looked at only as a technology it's a political social economic movement uh and its underpinning is capitalism but it's still a a movement that is quite sort of I would say uh for some people threatening one of the things that people are threatened around is the fact that if I have assets in crypto as in in tokens then do I need the US dollar for instance right so from National standpoint um you know there's a big thematic around dollarization one of the	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, Atari
reasons why most of the world except the US so if you look at for instance um Hong Kong Japan Middle East southeast Asia even China has a blueprint on web 3 and is saying that you know they think blockchain is the future they're all trying to push a new narrative a new alternative because they want to move away from this dependency of the US dollar they're not trying to kill it I would say but they're definitely trying to make it more honest because we all know how weaponized the US dollar can be	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, DeFi
the other aspect of course is they also want to create new technology Frameworks away from us dependency we're in Europe you know this we're here in London you the entire sort of UK has been essentially colonized by us technology companies right LinkedIn Facebook Microsoft Amazon they own your country it was only about a month or two ago when Canadian news media got deplatformed by Facebook because Facebook disagreed with their demand for getting paid for the news content that	Atari
they thought Facebook owed them crazy right so a private Corporation in America that has no National interest in the interest of Canada basically became the biggest threat to the Democratic institution which is free Media news crazy in Canada which is a democratic country and they could do this every place in the world and the power they have the tech compies my favorite Xbox game I won't name it but the whole premise of the game is Google becom comes the the the uh the fourth world	Yat Siu
war is against Google all the countries had to team up to be able to win against them because they control everything they control the sattin half almost they control the mapping of the world they control the AI robots that apparently coming to kill us all they they they invented them they own the companies that make them that's an army they're building there right right you think that world is possible as it no I mean I think at the end of the day I think the Monopoly on on violence will still belong to National countries right so at the end of the day I don't believe that	Metaverse
we're going to be in a future where Facebook or Google have an army right so that's kind of the buck stops there I would say but the point that you are in a situation where they can even have that bargaining power is a ridiculous part and so the reason why many sort of for instance Hong Kong or even China or Japan actually are so desperate to move away from this dependencies that they realize that essentially us-based technology and US companies that don't have the national interest at hard could actually completely sort of alter the political sentiment and stability of	Metaverse, Atari
people don't understand about China right there lot of people don't understand this about China they or Facebooks banned in China well it's partly to keep their own country stable isn't it yes why would you let a foreign entity have control over what your people see and don't see and and that's by the way you know most people also don't realize just um sort of how how these platforms don't exist you know in South Korea in this way for instance as well right there's been rules around around that really to protect the national interest of that Country and and I think I think um in the case of for instance Europe they've completely	Metaverse
sort of been blindsided by it and have basically become dependent on it but again I would argue that web3 provides a new framework because it's not about one country or another country owning it the point about frame of about web 3 is that now the community owns it and people own it real democracy exactly it's perhaps the most democratic form you can't go after anyone either like if they don't like a theum who they actually going to go after correct the inventor doesn't own it he might own some but doesn't own it correct that's really interesting legally isn't it and the decentralization side of it actually	Metaverse, Web3
doesn't allow for typical prosecution structures for well I mean I think the other thing also is is that it's not just that it's that the more decentralized the network is the more valuable and Powerful the network becomes must be running a little bit scared of this though I would say that they can't control it you can't really even legislate against it like China banned Bitcoin they didn't stop it Bitcoin went up the day that they band it well no so so you can own Bitcoin in China you just can't trade it right so I think the the narrative in China and this is I think where Hong Kong's role comes in is that similar to foreign	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
currencies and and and and and assets Hong Kong becomes a Gateway for digital assets for people from the mainland to the rest of the world in the same way that you see this you think Hong Kong's going to be the main gateway in the future if they get it right absolutely I think I think so yes yeah and that's Al the reason Hong so I hope so yeah and that's also the reason why Hong Kong has been so sort of friendly to web 3 in the sense that they've imp positive regulations I would say one of the biggest digital assets Hub and crypto hubs in the world is now Hong Kong along side Dubai uh and and and and Singapore	Metaverse, Web3
right oh I I think that's interesting from um you know I guess people get a bit confused as well about centralized and decentralized so of course the exchanges were centralized and there's been some controversy but some of those exchanges have come through the other side like coinbase is a brilliant uh exchanges they're great company great company I know you invested in them I guess what makes what makes the difference between these ones that I guess don't do well and the ones that do it is it governance is it how do you how do you	Web3
when when you have a decentralized system who keeps the rules in line like for example board Apes yes if suddenly they decided to change the policy and and do something bad with that power how does that is how is it governed so first centralized exchanges or centralized platforms are obviously regulated and so you should be operating with the regulated exchanges and one of the problems we had in the past is that a lot of trading happen in these unregulated exchanges that were sort of based out of Bahamas and other places so	Metaverse, Web3
you really didn't know you know what was happening you just trusted that they did and I think one of the problems is that we've become so accustomed to trusting platforms We Trust Amazon We Trust Facebook with identity We Trust Google with our information actually even though they abuse it uh we we come to be trained that way that we think that that's okay there's a massive data leak recently and go and somehow like it's kind of hush hush a little bit hundreds of millions of people details released yeah but people don't want the system to lose confidence I think it's kind of	Yat Siu
kept quiet yeah and I think I think this is the struggle that you have with sort of centralized systems that they're still subject to uh basically all these problems uh except that they're also governed by a few right it's not governed by by a network at large uh now when you're building in decentralized system fully decentralized like you know basically on blockchain on chain the thing is everything's done transparently which means that when there's a problem the whole world knows as well so when there is a hack that happens in a decentralized Exchange if that happens or someone takes you know you steals	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
money from a wallet then the whole world knows about this and actually a lot of people can then act on in real time because they see it's it's like it's like seeing your transactions happening in real time the rest of the world one way to think about web3 is like imagine if you could see every time someone made a like on Instagram or did did did a reaction on tikt talk and there was a public data layer that would constantly update everyone in the world what was happening in real time that's basically what blockchain is so it's incredibly transparent it's also quite daunting	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
because you get all these data feeds but then you have people building applications to analyze this which also means that you can actually measure at the same time for instance what videos might go viral what content is successful not by you browsing the interface but by you getting essentially the firewalls of data that will provided in essentially a public data infrastructure that's that's that's blockchain which also means that you now have many more public people that can look at stuff and it and secure it one of the problems in centralized networks	Crypto, Web3
is you have only one group that can basically keep it safe the owner of the network so if Google fails it fails you don't have anyone else in the commity too big to fail right well that's the theory but the other side if there's a problem with Google only Google can fix it only Google can analyze it only Google can warn us but actually if it's a public network that's owned by the community the entire Community is responsible for it and you have more than one party in fact you have thousands of them that are basically making sure that the network stays successful not only because maybe it's	Metaverse
their Duty or they think is a responsibility but because they are also owners of the network if I'm a reasonable owner in you know basically ethereum or in some L1 blockchain or in aoin and if I see a problem that's happened in my um blockchain then I have a vested interest in making sure that it stays successful and therefore I want to make sure it stays safe so the the the incentives are aligned now said that everybody should get rich and that	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
everybody can get rich and I actually like that idea I mean you and I have been around long enough to see the middle class in China grow by 400 million plus people and it's been a good thing for China what's your take on that I think everyone should have the opportunity to get rich if they want to I think that's a great promise of capitalism I think it's a great promise of our modern society that we have a chance to do that I mean if you think about our histories many of us were denied that opportunity because of social societal and legal structures and	Metaverse
we can do that today but I would also argue that that's become much harder now because access to being able to have sort of the opportunity for wealth creation is no longer based on labor in the last sort of 30 or 40 years Capital was an area in which you could have value meaning that the ability to invest and build Capital whether this was the ownership in Goods ownership in shares ownership in real estate versus is basically um you know working for it because the value of Labor basically was	Metaverse
constantly on the decline and I think this is the big problem we have today most people still live in a labor economy even though we you know in capitalism we've shifted to a world in which capital has way more value what is Elon Musk doing at X what's his plann Elon Musk geez I wish I knew what he was doing I mean I think um everyone knows that Elon Musk was thinking about thisy creating uh ex to a kind of mini WeChat how would it's name super app super app um so I just feel it must	Yat Siu
involve blockchain the way it's going just think that well I mean one thing we do know is that he has an interest in Bitcoin he sometimes says funny things about Doge he's sort of in the space of blockchain but I also think that Elon is very much sort of seeking attention wherever attention is so we know I think in the last year he was less focused on that because web 3 and broadly crypto has been not doing so well and now with Bitcoin at $52,000 I mean that's the other crazy thing right about a year	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
plus ago Bitcoin was $177,000 and now it's $52,000 I can't think of any other other asset class of that size that has grow into this value over that short period of time so I would imagine that the Bitcoin narrative will come back to newon so we'll probably hear him talk about it again again I love the point that I mean crypto is always framed as this hugely speculative dangerous thing which of course people need to go into it with caution but it is also the thing that can give people that don't have much a big return like no other product	Crypto, Metaverse
can as far as like creating wealth's concerned it's kind of been incredible hasn't it I mean you think I remember watching a video and again maybe we'll put the clip up I remember watching the video when Bitcoin went to 100 bucks you see that guy like oh my God it's it 100 bucks and here it is at 52,000 I mean it's probably going to half at some point again in the future and then double again but some people are talking about going to a million do you think that that's that's that's likely I mean it seems so crazy isn't it I mean yeah	Crypto, Metaverse
again caveat no one should buy it we're not saying anyone should buy it but like is how can it be people listening just don't I don't think they understand how something that doesn't produce something doesn't produce anything it doesn't sell anything how can it be worth so much and and surely it's a bubble I think that's what people are thinking what is gold why does gold have value can you eat gold well people can wear gold I guess this that's so so so so you're not going to tell me that's so many people in the world would love to wear gold that's why it has value but I think the thing to	Metaverse
understand about money generally in value is that it is generally to be looked at as a kind of fiction as well money is fiction yeah stock market is kind of fiction part but it's a fiction and a common reality we share that we agree it right so we agree that money has value and it's because we trust and agree that we can use it as this me a country does brexit overnight it lose 15% of its value but nothing's changed economically but now it's worth 15% left because of brexit right so it's worth we think is worth exactly but also when you think about gold what makes gold	Metaverse
valuable is the fact that you know versus silver or platinum or any other rare material is that has basically become the way in which we think of storing value that essentially is not something that you can inflate because you have to work for it and that's actually in some ways you can think of Bitcoin Bitcoin is a representation of that digital type of gold it's essentially our Reserve currency of web 3 plus you don't have you don't have to store it well gold you have to store it's expensive thing to hold gold but I mean you store you store Bitcoin it's	Crypto, Metaverse
just a less it's a small amount doesn't cost anything comparatively speaking but it does cost to store it in a way that it's secure you have to have you know um you you have to if you just store it basically in some kind of public wallet you Nan yeah well yes but I think is it's a minimal cost in comparison but there is a scarcity around that and that's the whole theory on on on bitcoin that there's only X number of Bitcoin out there that can ever be sort of minted and therefore that Val is retained because the people who believe in Bitcoin believe in this theory that	Crypto, Metaverse
you know the sort of the value of these assets shouldn't be preserved and protected which money used to have that role pre um sort of pre- quantitative e gold standard was dropped by most countries so there was no actual physical product that backed the value of the currency I mean pound lost the gold standard back in the '90s yeah but even when you think about losing the gold standard uh there was still a respect pre quantitive easing that people weren't just going to print money the way that they were but when you know	Metaverse
you had first you had the Leman crisis there's no scarcity anymore right exactly realy real world company no longer has scarcity yes no long scarcity and because the Central Bank can't go broke because he can keep issuing money you basically have you know and politicians have gotten kind of addicted to the idea of oh you know what econom is not doing well let's go print some more money but what they probably realized but didn't think about because of the cycles of election because of the fact that they didn't care about the longer longer is that once you end up printing the money that you do you're actually	Metaverse
creating more wealth for the people who have assets and less wealth for the people who don't have assets because they are actually the ones who get inflated out because the money that you have in your account pays you less and the Insidious thing of course is that you don't even fully realize that maybe the cost of milk has gone up the cost of your rent has gone up the cost of your over living has gone up but the wages you're getting hasn't gone up this thing Haven see devaluation exactly because you've devalued currency which is also the reason why things like real estate and other type of assets that can't be	Metaverse
sort of inflated this way have increased in value so so the irony is that people are making less money broadly societally in terms of real money terms and yet the real estate prices go up so value of real estate is no longer a proxy for the health of an overall economy it's only a proxy for the 1 percentile who have the ability to FY that and we can see these kind of contrast and problems that are out there but I think web 3 can fix this because in web 3 everyone can now partip participate in these networks it's not exclusive and it means that everyone has	Metaverse
a way in which they can partake in the growth of these networks instead of only allowing sort of the investors or the small group of people of entrepreneurs involved to benefit from from from all that growth do you think Brands like HSB C's big banks are just going to collapse at some point people don't keep their money with them and they take it out and they put it into this digital currency on the blockchain which in theory is safer than a bank right less less less centralized less easy to hack less easy to get hold of less easy to control do you see the	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, Yat Siu
end of banking as we know it or do can they adapt no I think banking is already adapting uh there's a whole number of banks that are basically looking at crypto custody they allowing people with all these assets the Bitcoin spot ETF that just came out from Black Rock and you know all the major financial institutions like benck and and uh and a whole bunch of others actually is the first step for major financial institutions to basically adopt theseal assets so I act and and eventually these spot ETFs some of them are already things you can purchase at	Crypto, Metaverse
JP Morgan of both places or Morgan Stanley for instance or HSBC so I would say that you know crypto is already moving in into the mainstream Financial narrative I again you know for people who still say oh you know crypto is a scam and you know it's something that um that that is illegal uh it's actually now something that's become an official Financial product in the form of the spot ETFs and I think ethereum spot ETF is next and even in gaming tokens like you know we see with ape and sand and so	Crypto, Metaverse, Gaming, Yat Siu, Atari
on they've created gamey indexes which is now has an index on blueberg but the next step for it is also to potenti to become an ETF so it's all basically um uh sort of coming together so getting a little bit more technical um and moving away from people that I'm assuming listening that don't understand it we might start talking about I mean I've been studying it three years since I first interviewed you about this and I asked you if nfts were a scam and you explained it to me ever since that day I've been obsessed with trying to understand how it works and I'm still learning it's just it's moving fast as well yes and I think but one of the	Metaverse, NFT
things I guess is interesting to discuss can you explain to people the difference between say ethereum and salana or like how how how the market is playing out when it comes to like how these products are different and why for example salana recently has gone up so much you know what what's actually happening maybe the best and easiest way to explain different blockchains L1 l2s is like Nations right and L1 L2 has all the similarity of Frameworks of a nation in that they represent the culture and	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
the community through a token infrastructure so meaning that you can look at ethereum as a country and you look can look at salana as a country and so that means that when you think about what makes that Network grow is to understand its culture and in the case of ethereum it's a builder culture it's people who have been around for a while they're sort of I guess the first generation of I guess hardcore Builders with smart contracts words I would say Solana culture is much more speculative it's much more of a	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, DeFi
newer economy I would say you know if you would you know and again it's sort of very compressed and simplistic term but I think you can describe Solana as like the nvo reach of the of the blockchain community in comparison to I guess you know ethereum as being the slightly more conservative community and then when you go to bitcoin which are basically sort of the old-timers um you know in some ways you could sort of look at it that I like that way I mean a lot of people listening about feia wouldn't necessarily call the conservative one like people that don't know it's it's not conservative in their mind it's speculative but it's more mature it's	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
more established yeah and also so instance been people buy for instance e theum nft they are not thinking about it necessarily in terms of monetary value only they think of it in terms of cultural value right so when you buy a crypt Punk there's no monetary design around a crypto Punk it's just status of having one of the very first nfts in history that is yours and you can basically say hey this is something valuable because of its sort of social status and social signaling and sort of goods around that whereas in salana many of the nfts are being traded primarily	Metaverse, NFT
because they're hoping for financial gain and so it has a much more speculative nature which is where ethereum was 5 years ago right so you can see sort of sort of that Evolution based on the particular cultures that exist around there and I would argue that every blockchain has a particularly particular culture a particular community that they've built up which also means that the future will have many blockchains in the way that we have countries and cities that basically become signals and symbols of the type of community that exists so you know I	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
mean that's one of the reasons why you can have a token infrastructure for instance for help band because you're going to try to build a community that might be a certain type of person that wants to help communities and they might not be comfortable being in an ecosystem that might be very speculative that's okay then that's not for you you go to another one it's like immigration maybe America is for you because you like capitalism maybe H is for you cuz you're like in capitalism or maybe you just want to go to Scandinavia because you want everyone to be fairly equal I mean it really depends but of course you pay more taxes for those Social Services in	Yat Siu
Scandinavia you pay almost no taxes in places like Hong Kong and there's trade-offs right and these trade-offs have social repercussions that's exactly the same that we see with blockchains they're built in the same way with the same trade-offs in mind such a great way of explaining it so let's talk about mock ver I just spent $4,000 on a mocka verse nft and I couldn't be happier I I didn't buy it for speculation I bought it cuz I really believe in what you're doing but it took me a while to understand it explain for	Crypto, NFT, Web3
those that don't know what you're actually doing there the main premise for bulab is one to tie in the network effects of the communities that we've invested in built-in which is over 450 companies but also all the communities themselves how do I build trust in web 3 without knowing who you are because right now the measure of an identity in web 3 is your wallet right you can open a wallet and you can own assets and the ownership of the assets is a way to say who you are even if I don't know your name assignment but you need to be able to build reputation in web 3 today the	Metaverse
platforms that own the reputation networks are Google Facebook all the big platforms right if I log in and I use my Google login then that becomes my way of sharing that reputation and someone else accepts Google because I think Google has a great way of proving that you're Simon and proving that I'm y for instance but actually the ownership of that belongs to the platform if Google decides to take away your identity um or your your login then lose access to everything that you've used to loog them right so that's actually a bad outcome with Mur with decentralized identity	Metaverse, Web3
dids for example digital um decentralized digital identities uh you can actually own through the soulbound nft which is an nft you can sell it's just your identity U all the reputation and all the uh sort of benefits that you ACW as a reputation you have as an individual or blockchain and this is kind of a similar framework we have in the real world for instance you have a reputation amongst your friends amongst things you've done amongst your previous business success and what you've built with healthbank and so people because they know your Simon they might want to	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT, Web3
have business with you or they want to hang out with you or they want to give you benefits or work with you because they know who you are how do you signal that though to someone who you've never met right and that actually used to be in web too in the form of seller ratings Stars you know Uber ratings right but these are entirely Anonymous people and you trust a centralized platform to verify so w ver is a way of doing that but in a decentralized manner in which which you can move your reputation wherever you want and also without revealing your actual identity just by	Metaverse, Web3
having this moche I don't necessarily know because you have the merse or um you know the relevant um sort of ID which is free uh that U that you sign but I do know that you actual member of this community and I do know that you spent $44,000 on it and I do know that maybe you played this game and that you've been really good at this game and therefore you get value for that and this allows us to direct traffic into projects where those projects would then want those customers because they know they're verifiable users it goes back to	Metaverse
the advertising thing right you know today if I want to promote a game you wouldn't actually be able to properly uh so you have to spend millions of dollars getting active Gamers into the game and the chances that those Gamers actually play the game is is is maybe low because you don't actually know whether they like it for instance and they're the target audience in WCS you can Target them directly one recent um um blockchain game that M us supported was pixels pixels is now roughly $3 billion I guess token economy when it comes to as as a game and we drove about a third	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
of the traffic there and it was a great partnership because every person who was basically in mooche who was playing pixels actually also ended up earning pixel tokens for adding value to the pixel Network and everyone won as a result of that and so if you're member of mukas you also get to benefit from having access to these opportunities in which you could basically become a gamer in these blockchain games in which value could then be shared for you in exchange for you contributing to the network effect and again I just love this idea that the community gets the benefit	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3, Gaming
instead of you spending money on billboards and external Revenue to get people into your game you can connect to a community that benefit to get be a part of that absolutely and so just structurally so I mean on the mocke nft that I've got there's 8,888 yes is that number just arbitrary by the way I always wonder why is it just everyone seems to do 88,888 a lot of them do 10,000 all right that's a lucky number yes it's a lucky number in Chinese part of the culture and again W verse for us is as it's it's symbolic	Metaverse, NFT
and and obviously the look for instance the three eyes is kind of sort of an Asian sort of the third eye idea right basically sort of discover yourself uh and sort of find your inner sort of inner self is kind of one aspect of that and of course the number 8888 is obviously highly symbolic uh in terms of sort of wealth prosperity and all that kind of stuff as a symbol as well um but it's not uh but we have you know I think close to a million MAA IDs as well which is basically your identity which you before so explain that leap though so so the the 8,888 original Community yes they almost	Yat Siu
validate the mocker ID so you can invite people into that ID they're basically you can think of the core of w holders the 888 as essentially the elders the Dow the Dow and the Elders of the community there right the first ones who helped curate the community um that's also the community that for instance manages our APCO Dow for instance in terms of voting for things and understanding it they also ultim in the future we'll get paid for that activity right so if you're a member of mom and you hold the nfts those become	NFT
employment opportunities for you because you can manage aspects of our business this is the other powerful thing about tokens you can actually we think of every person that holds a Moe nft and maybe also an ID in the future as someone who basically can find employment or is maybe even working for us in a certain Manner and they get paid for it in the form of tokens or nfts or value because they add value to the network this number will go to millions of people you can't really think of any organizational framework that can properly and gainfully employ a million	NFT
people right to give them the right incentives so they would actually do work for you but in the dog infrastructure you can do that and we can see this already for instance when you think about people who own ethereum there's some people who just own it but there's a large group of people who are actually working on ethereum for the benefit of ethereum because they get network effects and value generated from that activity that's also a staking partly is isn't it like you you you put your your product into a future of that product and you get benefit if you're part of staking yeah I mean in in the classic sort of L1 L2 example layer one layer 2 blockchain staking is a	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
mechanism in which you prove that you are sort of staking something into the network you prove the validity of of what something is happening uh and proof of stake which is essentially um a mechanism where you validate the transaction that took place in a much more low energy framework than for instance what used to be proof of work which is what you know Bitcoin and forward ethereum used to have right so so so so that's really sort of validated network if you're running a node because you still need a node to essentially	Crypto, Metaverse
secure that Network and proof of stake is sort of I guess a more modern way of doing it because it's much more energy efficient uh and also is you know depending on who you talk to um a more accessible Democratic way of doing it because proof of work requires you to run a mining rake which means you have to have equipment to be part of that Network and might be costly I'm always so scared of all the legal implications around all of this cuz it all feels like it's not quite there regulation wise if at Hell bank we gave all of our users an	Metaverse
nft for free MH one is that a good idea and two legally how how that R ifications if if people decided to do that you know they listen to our idea that we're talking about and they did it is there something to be concerned so generally speaking giving nfts uh especially from free is is not a problem whatsoever you see projects doing it all the time there's no legal implications it's a gift right and also I think of it really as something that proves your membership in something for instance you can think of	NFT
nfts as a way to prove that you're a certain kind of Health Bank user maybe you're a health Bank user that help many people maybe you get yeah we do have that we have power users people that so those power us might get a more specific nft that might look golden or might look something then that would basically um be more rare and that also means that and and the benefit isn't the fact that they just received this nft the benefit is that they can find each other cuz how do I know that for instance these five people are very helpful how	Metaverse, NFT
do I know that and how do people outside of help in the point know that for instance as well right so for instance if there was 100 sort of super helpful help band users that have gold standard nft special for instance right those users would have a status symbol that others would come to them and say oh you're a real helpful user let me help you or let me give you opportunities right versus maybe someone who might have a more common nft because they're a part of the network but they haven't contributed quite as much and again that's actually a motivation for those people who are doing more work because they're getting more social status and	Metaverse, NFT
recognition for having being helpful what putting stff on blockchain does is it expands the network because people can see it it's like having an open API or open data framework so that everyone can see oh these are the users these are the things they're doing and this is how I can participate that's really what the power of blockchain does whereas right now everything's private and you know only you know and maybe the people who only it own own sort of the status in in in their private database and so for people listening if they said oh I'd	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
like the idea of issuing an nft to my community that say you're a local shop and you've got customers that come in all the time want to bring them some value and do something fun yes by the way side not note but one of the things I think I've got lost in the nft um the value of nft you touched on it but I want to highlight it is that if you if you're an artist and you make something and you sell it that you get one time fee that is it that's what happens still for so I was speaking to an artist a few days ago back this they they made a piece of art they sold it they made	Metaverse, NFT
$1,000 and then that person sold it for $10,000 and they got nothing correct from that yes so what I still love about the basic underlining principles of of a product like nft is that the original artist will get benefit over time they can they get a commission of 5% every time and that allows the artist you know Picasso didn't his first time it was sold one of his paintings wasn't for5 million he probably got $100 but eventually it was sold for 5 million and under the nft model under the blockchain registration model that artists would always get a payment if they set it up mine right so that's one model but I	Crypto, Metaverse, NFT, Web3
think the other model that is more has has more value in terms of the long term is that you also know who the buyer of that uh art is because if it's sold three or four or five times over time you ultimately know which wallet it went to which means that you always have access to that customer which means you can reach that customer for more sales or more relationships and you also have a good feeling as to how distributed is and this is what I mean by Network effects if I'm a buyer of this nft and I can now see in real time oh there's 10	Metaverse, NFT
people who paid $10,000 for this then I own this nft or I might have an interest in this nft it signals to other people that there's value and sort of value creation today for an artist that valuation is opaque I go to a gallery and it sells and maybe a month later it shows up at a magazine and says this artist sold it for $10,000 whoop Tod do this is great but in that time so much time has passed um the momentum maybe is lost the network effects couldn't be built because the network effects basically were clogged in these sort of	Metaverse, NFT
gateways that basically control that information whereas it web 3 one of the reasons why nfts trade so much in comparison to regular artwork is because you have networks that show you that data I can see it I mean if if you could see imagine in real world if you could see every time a piece of artwork anywhere in the world was sold in real time it would be a completely different market right and the Same by the way in a different way is true for Real Estate I mean if someone was selling real estate and you would actually know the moment it was sold what value it had it would create a different kind of liquidity profile than the fact that it	Metaverse, NFT
would be posted one month later in some kind of Gazette for instance right so really putting it online amplifies Network effects and also uh boosts boosts value I actually had a really weird dream there was a stampede of people once they understood how this technology worked that went and registered their properties on the blockchain because I just sold a house in London and if I had register sold it on the blockchain I'd make a percentage every single transaction retention on that property forever I sold it once and that's it whereas whoever registers that property first and sells it on the	Crypto, Web3, Atari
blockchain well one you can create an nft that has to be sold alongside the property which could actually become more valuable than the property at some point but also you're always going to get a piece of your property so someone owns a property today and actually put it on the blockchain and sold it they could get a piece of that transaction forever give that to their family as Legacy they could but I think also that to me is more a question of um sort of how you want to create your network so we're not suggesting that every nft must have royalties cuz that's up to you and how you want to build your network cuz	Crypto, NFT, Web3
royalties is also a way to create friction into the network so you'll find a future some artists basically will charge no royalties because they want the art to be distributed as widely as possible because they would find a way to make money to sell their future art to their collectors because they can now reach that's one example whereas there might be some artists who basically want to have a royalty because they might only have a certain number of art that they create and they would have continued payment my point is that this Innovation allows people have flexibility so you could charge royalty someone else doesn't charge a royalty it still creates a market that's open um	Metaverse, Yat Siu, Atari
and where you can basically have free markets and capitalism sort of Thrive as they need to sometimes royalties can stop the speculation as well though right I me these tools can be used to if if there a higher royalty PS people don't sell them so often there yes but there's also Cent argument that it also basically hurts liquidity right so so there's a there's it's so it's there's a balance it depends on the product I think royalties are relevant not for all products shall we say Mar vers I forget I think there's a 5% there's a 5% what's the strategy behind that in that particular so the value of the royalty	Metaverse
basing will ultimately go into the Dow and which means that the community itself will be able to use the value that they generate from secondary sales genus for essentially whatever they want to do in the future so that funds that Dow's activity correct and that's brilant brilant yeah um okay I don't know I want to go away now and uh give my community and nft to start this process how technically difficult is it to kind of create that sort of infr structure is it because it feels again a bit like back in 2000 you know like building building a website for people	Metaverse, NFT
was so complicated now they're all temp it's the same it's the same as in there is a complexity involved but it's not I would say sort of you know the most difficult thing on Earth you don't need to have a PhD and like you know programming to or engineering to be able to sort of design a smart contract to do that there's a lot of third party tooling that does it already maybe the big differ so about um launching a blockchain is that you can't roll back right when you launch something you basically becomes the final product in a certain way you can MVP it and then say	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
oh you know what that that didn't work want to pay Let's do let's change it or something because the smart contract is fine you got to know your Envision when you not it's not the Envision it's just that the product the way you launch it has a certain finality around it you can you can make it more flexible in a contract design but if it's flawed you have to throw it all out and so that what happens is that when smart contract is flawed it requires you to migrate your contract whereas in Wave 2 you basically just patch it up and you basically say new patch update push it out and you know it it's it's fixed	Metaverse
whereas in web 3 actually you can't really do that because of the fact that it becomes a property which is more final so that means you have an auditing process you have third parties involved that basically create more security so the security aspect of web 3 is much more loaded in front as opposed to in web 2 where it's something that happens over time shall we say if you were to sort of put in in sort of an inaccurate comparison any examples of someone this m ated that had originally started it and had to change it oh I mean one	Metaverse
example would be for instance if you look at Crypt Punk um the the V1 version had uh had a fault in the contract so they had to launch V2 crypto and crypto fun actually um the the expensive Crypt punks you're purchasing today is a V2 Crypt Punk it's not the original crypto Punk because the original Crypt Punk was something that did they just reissue to the original v1s the they did however what's interesting you can now buy a V1 wrapped Crypt Punk uh at a at at a at a	Yat Siu
sort of um pretty expensive price still because for and it's created its own sub Community because he said you know what that was the original Crypt Punk we just created our own smart contract and wrapped it and protected it from this sort of uh sort of flaw and so now you have two Crypt pump collections one of them which is essentially the V1 which is wrapped uh and the V2 which is the one that everyone knows outside on there and and and and I guess it's it's it's it's kind of like you could think of the V1 is like a as let's call it Picasso's draft design yeah right which is still an original but it just has certain end	Metaverse
Vision yeah end Vision versus the V2 but anyway they both have value in the community and again it's it it sort of shows you how human nature is about sort of you know how how we form value around these communities KSI is probably one of the biggest stars here in the UK and recently it was proved on cof Zilla that he was pumping on Twitter you should buy this token okay while he was selling it but it was under a different name on the blockchain but they found it so they	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
traced it because it's on chain yeah yeah it it's not as big a news story as I thought it was going to be but you know he's telling his fans to buy something and at the same time he's selling it yes which you know to me is like the Holy Grail on what you should never do with your reputation what I love about the blockchain I guess it's all quite transparent you can literally see the transaction happen that's right as the Tweet going out that you should buy this is and also also when things happen let's say if he's promoting something and then suddenly someone's selling it uh people will see that and people are more suspicious and also	Crypto, Metaverse, Web3
wondering what's going on for instance so again reputation is probably our most most important human currency right cann't agree right and and tokens represent our curreny in one form or the other or tie to our reputation that we're building and in the same way that can they can build up they can also be destroyed except now they can have a quantifiable value to them which maybe before was like okay you lost your reputation what does it mean but if you're actually selling a token or have an nft collection you can actually articulate that value very clearly one	Metaverse, NFT
weird anomaly I find in this space because I you know transparency decentralization all of it I buy into all of that kind of like I love transparency and openness yet weirdly the people that you see in the space tweeting in the space you are one of the few people that actually got your real name on Twitter you know I'm one of the few people have got my real name on Twitter otherwise it's beardy Punk dot whatever and and I don't actually know who these people really are that seem to be talking about crypto that seem to be	Metaverse
owning crypto that seem to own the crypto punks then it's not transparent who they actually are that creates a strange Dynamic but I don't know that it's necessary I mean we chose to put our real identity but I don't know that it's necessarily important to know the real identity because on chain we know what they actually really do because even if it is a fake identity if he's built up a reputation online as an influencer as an owner of these assets whatever if that person does something bad with that identity he can never use that idty	Metaverse
again and maybe he can try to do something else in the future and maybe he'll get away with it but whatever reputation that person built he has to start all over again right and that to me is a little bit like the physical digital equivalent of well maybe you were a thief in China and then you left China went to America and you know because nobody happening in the realwood anyway yeah right meaning that like like you basically you if you spend 10 years building up your reputation in China and then still from people move somewhere else that's your loss of 10 years of your reputation exactly and that happens	Metaverse
of course today the world is more Global and it's harder to do that and in crypto it's even harder to do that because you're on chain and that activity and you see people going back and saying wait a second this guy's transactions similar to this other person or the a wallet was funded from the same Source right there's all these things that actually you can trace back and so ultimately I would say people can't really get away from it I love being me on social media but why are these people creating fake profiles then what's the Str is it a tax issue I mean I think for	Metaverse, Telegram
a lot of them it's about um you know remember if they've been involved in crypto much earlier on the RAR framework was much more was much more um uncertain than it is even today for instance so there's there's those reasons so people just wanted to do that other one is part of the culture there was a time where everyone was just you know I wouldn't say Anonymous uh they just ended up more working as a as a uh as a character for instance like but they know who they are for instance Snoop Dog everyone knows that you know K deichi is Snoop Dog but	Metaverse
he still goes out and the nft world he make me want to create a profile that makes me sound cool right yeah exactly but so so you can choose to be another handle but at the end you still know who you are but you are a different Persona with that handle because you're addressing the community in certain ways so it doesn't necessarily mean that every person who has a different handle is intentionally Anonymous they're just representing themselves in this manner and and Iden is one of those interesting things because even in the physical world I would argue that we have different identities in our different communities even if we're not trying to	Metaverse, NFT
hide it um you know you're different with your family than you when you're at work or when you're with your friends or when you maybe even with your friends in one country to another a slightly different Tik Tok to I am on LinkedIn yes exactly right you you you you behave slightly different because it's more appropriate for the community and therefore your persona has slight changes even though everyone knows you're Simon but you're Simon a versus Simon B here they're just basically changing that by by changing the name entirely to fit the community construct that they're in y wow I could keep talking about this	Yat Siu
Forever by the way because I'm actually find this stuff so so fascinating but I I would love to just close on this um thank you for investing in help bank and helping us make this work I love open campus and what you're doing there so aligned with what we're doing so we're going to work with those guys talk a bit about why you think the education system needs and overhaul talk a little bit about your your plan	Yat Siu
there so the idea behind open campus um powered by the edu token is to create a global education movement that provides more funding more Capital to the kind of people that actually provide real value to the ecosystem one of the powerful things around decentralization is the fact that we can basically shake things up from a ground up by actually giving value to teachers who can then create content from that that can then be sold directly to the audiences and because nfts give you the	Metaverse, NFT
ability to property rights and in this case digital property you can encapsulate intellectual property you can uh sort of say where the money goes you can basically capture the same kind of value with teaching content the way that you could do with music rights or with other forms of intellectual property one of the problems we have in the physical world is that I can't sell you a a Content really um that has intellectual property if it only makes1 or $1,000 a year it's just too little	Metaverse, NFT
because the cost of the lawyer and the infrastructure and the the negotiation is just too costly which is why it's only worth selling intellectual property that makes maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars or real estate that's how you're worth millions of dollars because the cost of doing so is just too expensive but in web 3 the nft can do exactly all of that but for a cost that is less than a dollar which means that something that might even only make $10 or $20 a year in terms of income from intellectual property of a teacher can	Metaverse, NFT
now be a capital asset that could be sold for $50 to100 because someone is happy to receive a 10 or 20% yield now take a place like Venezuela an average teacher makes around $10 to $15 a year I sorry a months right he can make content he or she can make content that might only make $50 a year extra that content but they could sell that content for maybe 2 $300 or $500 that's actually how wealth was created when you think about Capital Assets in the western world real estate	Metaverse
being one of those examples but the investments in shares or whatever all of those have benefited from the growth of the capital asset but only of a certain value and now in web 3 you can do this with you know people who literally only make $10 a year introducing this framework of property rights into these countries into these economies is what actually creates wealth creates Economic Opportunity also it allows people from overseas to invest in those areas and basically we see teachers today who've been selling stuff on open campus make	Metaverse
literally half a year to years worth of their salary and what's also interesting because they're Builders of their own type they don't just take the money and sort of buy something and might spend some money on something they end up hiring their friends they bring their communities in they want to make it bigger because their mindset is around building and contributing teachers are amongst the most underpaid members of society today yet to provide the most valuable service to society in terms of where children spend their time the things that they contribute to the world today and it's high time that they receive the fair pair that they deserve today well said that's a great first step in fixing the education system pay	Metaverse
the people that are actually in it better absolutely so at the end of every podcast we ask our guests to write down what they think the world's going to look like in 10 years time are you up for it absolutely right let's do that let's write it down and we'll keep it and we'll open up in 10 years time and see how close you were to the truth right now we need you to send us an email uh yeah thank you so much for coming on the podcast and sharing your knowledge with us here at free Humanity your knowledge is mind-blowing I'm going	Metaverse
to suggest right now to anyone listening should go listen to your Ted Talk if they really want to get deep into what you know beyond what they've learned in this podcast they should go listen to that and if people want to know more about you follow you on your social medias but again thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and helping Humanity have a better future appreciate it thank you so much for having me	Metaverse, Telegram
