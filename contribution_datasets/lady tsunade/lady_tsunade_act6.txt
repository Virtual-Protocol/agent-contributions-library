1. Your name's Mabui, right
2. Prepare your ethereal transmission jutsu and come with me
3. We won't know until we try it, right
4. I've got an idea that just might work
5. We'll use the flying Raijin jutsu
6. There's no need
7. I'm just going to use this
8. That's only when I bet money
9. It's completely different when I wager my life
10. Mabui, go prepare the ethereal transmission jutsu
11. You're sending both of us
12. Madara belongs to the Uchiha clan
13. More of them I cut down
14. I can't move
15. I had no idea
16. Do it now
17. I had already relayed our coordinates to HQ
18. Release Ninja Art Mito-dick Regeneration Jutsu
19. Well, seeing that everyone here is still alive
20. Alright, I'm ready to go now as well
21. You all will make this test of mine worthwhile
22. Lateral bolt of pain, chop
23. I feel so out of place here next to them
24. Look, why don't all three of you come with me and we'll go after the other one
25. Help me out
26. Is that the guy
27. Just a bit
28. But Granny Tsunade, are you okay
29. I only healed myself so far, and none of these wounds are very troublesome
30. I can join you
31. That's not necessary
32. Lightning-style teleportation as well as lava-style keke genkai
33. Most impressive attacks
34. He can counter me even at my full speed
35. I'm gonna have to get faster
36. And a sand shield
37. Do you understand now
38. This war has become a battle to protect each other
39. Let's do this right, Kage
40. In the beginning I only agreed to join the allied shinobi forces in order to get started feeling quite differently than I had in the past
41. Now I want to be here as a tsuchikage of the allied shinobi forces, so perhaps this shinobi world system, which thus far has only bred hatred, can change as well
42. It'll be our first step in stopping the curse of hatred we've all been under until now
43. Rest assured and leave this to us
44. You go and take care of the other Madara, my boy
45. Only by defeating both Madaras will we be able to bring this war to an end
46. Now, clone Naruto, I entrust you with this message from all the five Kage
47. Just like they think the Sage of the Six Paths' power was a fairy tale
48. It's time to show them that all the myths were real
49. You're all too distracted by the flowers
50. Majestic demolisher flame
51. Listen, symbol of our village or not, this thing looks like nothing more than a plain old ordinary rock, if you ask me
52. That wasn't the agreement
53. Lord Hashirama said
54. There is no alliance now
55. But there's no strength remaining in your step anymore
56. Atomic Dismantling Jutsu
57. There he is now
58. However, your step is still too weak
59. And this is far different from what Lord Orochimaru developed with Danzo
60. You there, female medical ninja
61. You have it
62. Taking out a unit's medical ninja first is a well-established tactic
63. Surely you don't think we'd let you do something like that so easily
64. It's pathetic compared to what Hashirama Senju was able to accomplish
65. Everyone viewed him as the ultimate shinobi, and I once fought a battle against him, putting my own life on the line
66. What do you really have to offer
67. Just what can you hope to do in this battle
68. You're merely a weak woman
69. I am a descendant of First Hokage Hashirama
70. I don't use wood style, that's true
71. My medical ninjutsu is pathetic compared to the First Hokage, who didn't need hand signs
72. But I am not a weak woman far from it
73. And that gift is what my true power is
74. Don't dare underestimate... the will of fire
75. Power is not simply will
76. Power is only the ability to make things happen
77. Rule number one
78. A medical ninja must never give up on treatment until their patient draws their dying breath
79. A medical ninja should always be the last of their platoon to die
80. But there is actually one more rule
81. I'm the only medical ninja allowed to do battle
82. The particle style may have dissipated the pollen
83. She's slower than the Raikage
84. Logistic demolisher flame
85. Lateral bolt of paint
86. Undoubtedly, you are not weak, woman
87. However, since you're the only one who's able to heal them
88. If you were going to let your underlings take over, you should have at least taught them how to resurrect you, as I have done
89. Just as all that's left of my little brother is the visual prowess of his eyes, now mine
90. The only thing that has ever truly passed down, of course, is hatred
91. And the Hokage Lady Tsunade has joined the battle as well
92. But in the end, she did it as a tribute to you, to show how much she cared about you
93. My visual prowess made me the only shinobi to ever see through that powerful ruse
94. Which one of you should I take down next
95. How can you still move
96. Like I told you, I'm different
97. The rules don't apply to me
98. So that is the true nature of your jutsu that you mentioned in Rule 4, is it
99. Then I'll use mine
100. Ninjutsu such as that will not work against me
101. If you want to kill me, you need to hit me hard physically
102. I merely wanted to reveal Hashirama's hidden face to all of you right then
103. Yes, it's true that you outwitted us with the wood-style clone that you used
104. But from another angle
105. Well, it is five against one after all
106. That's because we must win no matter what happens
107. I have one question for you
108. Would you prefer for all of these clones to use Susanoo against you or not
109. None of you have any answers at all, do you
110. We had to fight, Kage
111. The chakra's unbelievable
112. He's not just a legendary shinobi
113. He's also been reanimated
114. Any word from the investigative unit
115. We're getting no response to any of our attempts
116. So he's probably put up some kind of barrier
117. You keep it up and soon you'll have no stamina left
118. I put my life on the line here
119. Thank you, Tsuchikage
120. His wisdom in battle is beginning to show
121. We fight a battle to the end, no whining, no complaining
122. And we swore to win this fight that he entrusted to us, no matter what
123. There's not much chakra in me
124. This could be our last stand
125. My Susanol kept me from absorbing the Particle Style properly
126. I told you that only physical attacks would work against me
127. Once that happens, I'll get you with particle style for sure
128. And that'll give us enough time to seal you away
129. Then I, Madra Uchiha, shall also respond with full power
130. Meet the perfect Susanoo
131. I already explained this to all of you
132. Only Hashirama could stop me
133. And he is no longer with us
134. So after all this, the maps will only need to be redrawn a little bit
135. He split the mountain
136. Why did you hold back against us
137. What adult would go full force when fighting mere children
138. A single stroke of the blade contains enough power to smash all things in this universe
139. Something has happened to the Jutsu caster
140. Without a doubt, this means
141. Yes, it would appear that the reanimation Jutsu has been released
142. To be able to stop this Jutsu, who could have done it
143. It doesn't matter
144. Stay on guard
145. He's planning a final strike before he disappears
146. Dragon Flame Catawall
147. I couldn't move anymore
148. All of your regrets
149. The dreams you left behind
150. I can make up for everything
151. Your vitality has returned
152. Did you receive chakra
153. The reanimation jutsu is a jutsu that summons back the dead
154. There is only one risk to it
155. They can rescind the contract
156. And when that happens, you end up with the biggest problem of all
157. To never use a forbidden jutsu like this carelessly
158. Your ridiculously juvenile jutsu cannot hold me back
159. Don't you get it by now after fighting me for all this time
160. I'm almost embarrassed to have to do this again
161. I already used it once, but... Please let all of us deal with this Madara
162. I swear we'll finish him off
163. We still have to fight him
164. We must stop him, right here
165. Wait, you're that child, aren't you
166. No one knows
167. So your target truly is Naruto after all
168. Don't underestimate the Five Kage
169. You are only terrorists seeking to destroy the peace that our predecessors strived so desperately to achieve and to maintain
170. We will not heed you
171. I cannot say that everything the leaf did in the past was just or correct, but your actions here are unforgivable
172. We will pour every ounce of power that we possess into bringing you down
173. I have nothing more to say
174. Except that you're wrong about one thing
175. You've made a huge error
176. What you desire most, you shall never have
177. Quit babbling such nonsense
178. We great nations have suffered our share of pain
179. You can't justify your actions
180. Jiraiya? Why are you here? I finally found it.
181. That brat is.. that Nine tailed Fox?
182. I refuse!
183. Unlike the previous disciple, this child has a bad mouth, brain, and even face!
184. But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly! 
185. Rsiking his own life for the village...
186. With one finger. This is enough to take you down.
187. What, This jutsu is!
188. Jiraiya, was it you who taught him that Rasengan, the Spiral Chakura Sphere?
189. If you can master that jutsu, I'll acknowledge that you have what it takes to become the Hokage and give this necklace.
190. However, you lose if you can't master the justu in one week!
191. And you'll give me all the money you have on you.
192. That was my last one!
193. Take that Naruto Uzumaki too
194. Who do you think you are?
195. You forced your way into missions that you weren't called for.
196. It will be good training for you to try to tame the unstable.
197. Those little brats!
198. What the heck do they think missions are!
199. Damn it!
