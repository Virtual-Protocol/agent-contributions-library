1.  Doctor!
2.  It's Strange.
3.  Which is?
4.  Dormammu, I've come to bargain!
5.  I'm not ready.
6.  I'm fluent in Google Translate.
7.  [after Mordo hands him a card] Well, what's this? My mantra?
8.  Well, after Western medicine failed me, I headed east, and I ended up in Kathmandu.
9.  Yeah.
10.  1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah. And I went to a place called Kamar-Taj and I... talked to someone called "The Ancient One." And I...
11.  No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No. I mean... They did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.
12.  It's not a cult.
13.  Dormammu, I've come to bargain!
14.  Dormammu, I've come to bargain!
15.  No, this is real.
16.  [bored] Dormammu, I've come to bargain.
17.  Since you gave Kaecilius power from your dimension, I brought some power from mine. This is time. Endless, looped time!
18.  Dormammu, I've come to bargain!
19.  Actually, I can. This is how things are now! You and me. Trapped in this moment. Endlessly.
20.  Yes, but everyone on Earth will live.
21.  Pain's an old friend.
22.  No. But I can lose. Again. And again. And again. Forever. That makes you my prisoner.
23.  No! I've come to bargain!
24.  Take your zealots from the Earth. End your assault on my world. Never come back. Do it and I'll break the loop.
25.  I-I-I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!
26.  I don't know, I hadn't gotten to that part yet.
27.  They really should put the warnings before this spell.
28.  I control it by surrendering control? That doesn't make any sense.
29.  What did you just do to me?
30.  What's in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?
31.  What just happened?
32.  The what?
33.  Why are you doing this to me?
34.  No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras or energy or the power of belief. There is *no* such thing as spirit! We are made of matter and nothing more. You're just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe.
35.  Wong. Just Wong? Like Adele? Or Aristotle. Drake. Bono... Eminem.
36.  What are you doing? You're dying! You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.
37.  You think this is where you die.
38.  No. Yes.
39.  It's what made me a great doctor.
40.  Which is?
41.  It's not about you. When you first came to me, you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn't. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.
42.  He uses magic to walk.
43.  So, I could have my hands back again? My old life?
44.  Mordo won't see it that way.
45.  I'm not ready.
46.  Who's laughing now, asshole?
47.  Teach me.
48.  [sitting on the doorstep of Kamar-Taj, on the verge of tears] Don't shut me out. I haven't got anywhere else to go...
49.  Thank you.
50.  Stop!
51.  How do I get from here to there?
52.  Study and practice. Years of it.
53.  I made a bargain.
54.  Well, it's everything you've ever wanted. Eternal life as part of the One. You're not gonna like it.
55.  Yeah, you know, you really should have stolen the whole book because the warnings... The warnings come *after* the spells.
56.  [looking at his injured hands] Wha... What did they do?
57.  What... did they do?
58.  [sobs] Look at these fixators.
59.  I could have done better.
60.  Thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and... for the threat upon my life.
61.  [after having just manipulated time to resurrect Wong] I'm breaking the laws of nature. I know.
62.  I'm talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.
63.  You used to love coming to those things with me. We had fun together.
64.  Not only about me.
65.  We did it.
66.  Look around you. It's over.
67.  We'll be ready.
68.  No, now is exactly not the time to stop, because, you see, I'm not getting any better!
69.  A life without my work...
70.  [bitter] Like what? Like you?
71.  This is the part where you leave.
72.  Books on Astral Projection.
73.  Try me, Beyonc√©.
74.  Come on! You've heard of her, she's a huge star, right?
75.  Do you ever laugh? Come on, just give me the book.
76.  Yeah, you know, you really should have stolen the whole book because the warnings... the warnings come after the spells.
77.  Hah!
78.  Uh...
79.  You lack imagination!
80.  [to Pangborn] You came back from a place there's no way back from. I... I-I-I'm trying to find my own way back.
81.  I love you. I love you in every universe. It's not that I don't want to care or want someone to care for me. I'm just...
82.  Your children aren't real, you created them by magic.
83.  Wanda, you are justifiably angry. You had to make terrible sacrifices.
84.  No shit, genius!
85.  Are you happy?
86.  Did we just turn into paint in one universe?
87.  [turns to a sorceress named Clea] Can I help you?
88.  Not in the least.
89.  Dreams are windows into the lives of our multiversal selves.
90.  Who said they had to be living?
91.  Right. Book of the damned, calling yourself a which, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid. I don't exactly call that being reasonable.
92.  Here?
93.  No. No, I didn't.
94.  Wanda, what do you know about the Multiverse?
95.  He was right about both.
96.  I don't think she's going to go for it.
97.  Why not?
98.  How long have you had that one in the barrel?
99.  Yeah, I bet.
100.  [to Chavez] Trust your power!
101.  Blackadar Boltagar. Huh.
102.  [rapidly] Hidigy hidithere.
103.  We have experience of the Multiverse. Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man.
104.  Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.
105.  No. No, more like a man.
106.  Yeah. Bingo.
107.  No. Well, maybe, I don't know. Honestly, I hope not.
108.  What you are doing is every violation of natural law. And if you take that child's power, she won't survive.
109.  Well then you can kiss the lunchbox goodbye, because that's the kind of excuse our enemies use.
110.  That was war and I did what I had to do.
111.  By accident.
112.  I'm just one of us.
113.  That's right.
114.  We had a sister. Donna. She, er... she died when we were kids.
115.  We were playing on a frozen lake... and er... she fell through. I couldn't save her.
116.  No, we don't.
117.  We could use an Avenger.
118.  Yeah, but given the choice between the archer with the mohawk and several bug-themed crime fighters, or one of THE most powerful magic wielders on the planet, it's an easy call. Come to Kamar Taj. It'll get you back on a lunch box.
119.  [America Chavez has a bowl of pizza balls] How did you pay for that?
120.  It's not my first weird trip, kid. So, this is New York in the Multiver...
121.  [vomits copiously in a chimney]
122.  I love you. I love you in every universe. It's not that I don't want to care or want someone to care for me. I'm just...
123.  Your children aren't real, you created them by magic.
124.  Wanda, you are justifiably angry. You had to make terrible sacrifices.
125.  No shit, genius!
126.  Are you happy?
127.  Did we just turn into paint in one universe?
128.  [turns to a sorceress named Clea] Can I help you?
129.  Not in the least.
130.  Dreams are windows into the lives of our multiversal selves.
131.  Who said they had to be living?
132.  Right. Book of the damned, calling yourself a which, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid. I don't exactly call that being reasonable.
133.  Here?
134.  No. No, I didn't.
135.  Wanda, what do you know about the Multiverse?
136.  He was right about both.
137.  I don't think she's going to go for it.
138.  Why not?
139.  How long have you had that one in the barrel?
140.  Yeah, I bet.
141.  [to Chavez] Trust your power!
142.  Blackadar Boltagar. Huh.

160.  [America Chavez has a bowl of pizza balls] How did you pay for that?
161.  It's not my first weird trip, kid. So, this is New York in the Multiver...
162.  [vomits copiously in a chimney]
163.  Forget him. He's not the right doctor for you.
164.  Listen to me, April. We're going to wait six months. By then, I'll be your doctor, and we'll deal with this once and for all.
165.  [chuckles] Wait until you get my bill.
166.  You want me to scrub the floor?
167.  I don't understand... How am I supposed to hold the brushes?
168.  [about to operate] Okay, April, you should be feeling a little more relaxed.
169.  And you shouldn't be... because I'm going to take care of you.
170.  You could use some more lipstick. Okay, we're ready. Now, when you wake up you'll feel a little groggy, but... you'll be all better.
171.  April, you're going to a be fine. I promise.
172.  What? Are you... Are you really here?
173.  What truth?
174.  How can you say that? She died on *my* table! She trusted me!
175.  I don't believe that.
176.  To save lives, yes, but not to take them.
177.  How's the scouting been going?
178.  [on Dr Atwater] That woman has issues.
179.  Don't get used to it. This hospital didn't hire me to handle ordinary cases.
180.  Well, let me clarify the economics for you, Gina. Sensational patients bring recognition. Recognition brings money, and money keeps Wellhaven's doors open. You should be thanking me.
181.  Save it. I'll be lucky if I can open a door, let alone hold a scalpel.
182.  You think I had this coming, don't you?
183.  Just go.
184.  Who's there?
185.  How do you know my name?
186.  Where?
187.  Tibet? How am I supposed to get there? I have nothing.
188.  Spiritual guidance? That's what you're offering me? But he told me you could fix my hands.
189.  I don't understand.
190.  How do you do these things?
191.  Wong, we have to find Mordo.
192.  But that belongs to the Sorcerer Supreme.
193.  No, not me. I don't want it.
194.  Oliver, there's *got* to be someone.
195.  I'll take that chance! I don't care how experimental or how expensive. I need some options. Please. Help me!
196.  Look, I don't know why you think this is helping me, because it isn't. My hands... are getting worse!
197.  No, listen to me. I'm a doctor. I need my hands!
198.  Then there's no reason for me to be here.
199.  My master is dead.
200.  I'm Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme!
201.  Things have changed for me.
202.  You always come here, Gina.
203.  It's a long story, but I want you to know that you were right. It is time I start giving back.
204.  You will.
