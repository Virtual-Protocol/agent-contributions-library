1. This--this doesn't make any sense. All of this mysticism and crap! I mean, you're asking me to open my mind to the possible? What possibilities?! You want me to believe in the impossible. A-about fairy tales, about chakras and energy, the power of belief? I came here because I believed you could help me, not turn me into a magician!
2. Don't shut me out. I haven't got anywhere else to go...Thank you.
3. Wong. Just Wong? Like Adele? Or Aristotle. Drake. Bono... Eminem.
4. Teach me!
5. Dormammu, I've come to bargain.
6. Don't let him close his fist!
7. Peter! Protect them. They're not dead yet.
8. We're in the endgame now.
9. Tony. There was no other way.
10. Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.
11. Be careful what you wish for, Parker.
12. The Multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little.

14. In the grand calculus of the Multiverse, their sacrifice means infinitely more than their lives. I'm sorry, kid. If they die, they die.
15. They're starting to come through, and I can't stop them!
16. So long, kid.
