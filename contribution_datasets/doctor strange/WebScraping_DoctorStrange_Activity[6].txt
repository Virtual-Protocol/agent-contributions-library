1. I control it by surrendering control
2. That doesn't make any sense
3. It's good tea
4. Did you heal a man named Pangborn, a paralyzed man
5. You helped him to walk again
6. How did you correct a complete C7, C8 spinal cord injury
7. You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic
8. It's the cells
9. You're talking about cellular regeneration
10. That's bleeding edge medical tech
11. Is that why you're working here without a governing medical board
12. I mean, just how experimental is your treatment
13. So you figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal
14. The spirit to heal the body
15. How do we do that
16. Where do we start
17. Oh, no, it's really good
18. It's just, you know, I've seen it before in gift shops
19. You're showing me an MRI scan
20. I do not believe this
21. I spent my last dollar getting here
22. Want my ticket, and you're talking to me about healing through belief
23. No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras or energy or the power of belief
24. There is no such thing as spirit
25. We are made of matter and nothing more
26. You're just another tiny momentary speck within an indifferent universe
27. Gotta turn the ship around
28. Now he wants to run
29. I want to protect the stone
30. Nearly blasting me into space
31. I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet
32. Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you
33. I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here
34. What is he, your ward
35. Can you get us home
36. I think I'm not so sure we should
37. Under no circumstances can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos
38. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here
39. We go to him, but you have to understand, if it comes to saving you, or the Kid, or the Time Stone, I will not hesitate to let either of you die
40. I can't, because the universe depends on it
