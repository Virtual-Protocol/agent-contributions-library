1. No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras or energy or the power of belief
2. There is no such thing as spirit
3. We are made of matter and nothing more
4. You're just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe
5. Oh, you think you see through me, do you
6. Well, you don't
7. But I see through you
8. What did you just do to me
9. What's in that tea
10. Why are you doing this to me
11. This isn't real
12. I was gonna say real
13. So I can see
14. But you put things right in the end, and that was never in doubt
15. I'm not here to talk about Westview
16. What do you know about the multiverse
17. Well, he was right about both
18. We found a girl who can somehow travel across it, but she's being pursued
19. Some kind of demon
20. One that covets her power for itself

26. I wonder what it's done to you
27. What do you want with America
28. What do you want with the multiverse
29. Wanda, your children aren't real
30. You created them using magic
31. I am happy
32. What you're doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law, and if you take that child's power, she won't survive
33. Well, you can kiss the lunchbox goodbye, because that's the kind of justification our enemies use
34. Was it war
35. and I did what I had to do
36. What happens now
37. And if we don't
