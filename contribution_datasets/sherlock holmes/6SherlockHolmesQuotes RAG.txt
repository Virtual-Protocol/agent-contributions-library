1. It's okay, I'm fine.
2. Now, show me to the stream.
3. It is a chemical defect found in the losing side.
4. It's the frailty of genius, John. It needs an audience.
5. I need to go to my mind palace.
6. I'm not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
7. Do your research.
8. Look at you lot.
9. You're all so vacant.
10. Is it nice not being me?
11. It must be so relaxing.
12. People don't really go to heaven when they die. They're taken to a special room and burned.
13. Your mind is so placid, straightforward, barely used. Mine's like an engine racing out of control, a rocket tearing itself to pieces, trapped on the launch pad.
14. I need a case!
15. Four serial suicides and now a note. Oh, it's Christmas.
16. Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.
17. Isn't it hateful?
18. Who cares about decent?
19. The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on.
20. Anderson, don't talk out loud.
21. You lower the IQ of the whole street.
22. I don't have friends. I've just got one.
23. Mrs. Hudson, leave Baker Street? England would fall.
24. Very, very close, but no.
25. You got carried away.
26. The game was too elaborate.
27. You're enjoying yourself too much.
28. Oh, enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine.
29. Craving the distraction of the game, I sympathize entirely, but sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side.
30. Because I took your pulse.
31. I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me, but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive.
32. When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait.
33. How true of you, the combination to your safe, your measurements.
34. But this, this is far more intimate.
35. This is your heart, and you should never let it rule your head.
36. You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you've worked for.
37. But you just couldn't resist it, could you?
38. I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage.
39. Thank you for the final proof.
40. And this is just losing.
41. I hope the contents make up for any inconvenience I may have caused you tonight. I'm certain they will.
42. If you're being kind, lock her up. Otherwise, let her go.
43. I doubt she'll survive long without her protection.
44. Sorry about dinner.
45. I'm afraid, John, I can't congratulate you.
46. All emotions, and in particular love, stand opposed to the pure cult reason I hold above all things.
47. A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world.
48. Today we honor the Death Watch Beetle that is the doom of our society, and in time one feels certain our entire species.
49. But anyway, let's talk about John.
50. If I burden myself with a little helpmate during my adventures, it is not out of sentiment or caprice.
51. It is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me.
52. Indeed, any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes in truth from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides.
53. It is a fact I believe that brides tend to favor exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day.
54. There is a certain analogy there, I feel.
55. And contrast is, after all, God's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation. Or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot.
56. The point I'm trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant, and all-round obnoxious asshole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet.
57. I am dismissive of the virtuous, unaware of the beautiful, and uncomprehending in the face of the happy.
58. So if I didn't understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody's best friend—certainly not the best friend or the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.
59. John, I am a ridiculous man, redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship.
60. But as I'm apparently your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion.
61. Actually, now I can.
62. Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I am capable.
63. John, you have endured war and injury and tragic loss.
64. So sorry again about that last one.
65. Today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved. In short, the two people who love you most in all this world.
66. I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that.
67. This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful—really useful.
68. Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish, and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters.
69. Do you see?
70. Oh, hell, what does that matter?
71. So we go around the sun, or we went around the moon, or round and round the garden like a teddy bear. It wouldn't make any difference.
72. All that matters to me is the work. Without that, my brain rots.
73. Put that in your blog. Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world.
