1. I'm curious, coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders, or just the one I prevented
2. Very distinctive, those handmade shoes of yours
3. But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave
4. Nonetheless, I confess to being completely outmatched
5. I could deduce very little from my investigation
6. Fortunately, there's nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you
7. How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today
8. Man, ox, eagle, lion
9. The lion is parliament, isn't it
10. No, but I don't care much what you think
11. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you've given it to me
12. I've told you nothing
13. But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope
14. The mud smeared on your boots from where you've been walking
15. A touch of red brick dust on your knee from where you've been kneeling
16. A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing
17. A faint aroma of excrement from where you've been standing
18. You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath Parliament, less than an hour ago
19. If both houses meet today, the whole government will be present
20. There isn't any time to waste, then
21. I told you he'd be coming out of the top window, soldier boy
22. There isn't any way he'd be coming out of that terrace
23. Well, technically, that isn't the top window
24. Is it, sailor boy
25. What is it
26. Well, it's the middle window
27. You'll be pleased to know that Lestrade performed his role perfectly
28. In fact, I think he rather enjoyed it
29. I hope you know what you're doing, Holmes
30. Here's the key
31. You got all you needed from Coward
32. Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease
33. Tanner, if you would, Captain, take us under the bridge
34. Portside, approximately 100 yards beyond that, you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers
35. Right away, sir
