27. In 2019, after trading on my own for about a year, I joined a fund where I was given a trading account. Managing a larger sum of money opened my eyes to the importance of selling into strength and understanding how big traders influence the market more than small ones.	Understanding
28. Trading with a larger account helped me realize that most market moves are driven by big traders getting trapped in positions, leading to significant price movements. This experience shaped my approach to trading, focusing on the behavior of large accounts and their impact on the market.	Technology
29. I spent a lot of time in 2019 and 2020 monitoring every trade on major derivatives platforms, like BitMEX and Binance. By closely watching how traders positioned themselves, I learned to predict future market moves based on open interest and the behavior of these larger participants.	Economics, Society, Ethics
30. Understanding why traders open or close positions is crucial. For example, if a lot of positions are opened, I analyze the exact moment to see how it affects futures prices. This helps in building a profile of the current market participants and their potential actions.	"Technology  
Innovation

32. In the morning, I review market data to understand overnight movements, focusing on derivatives and spot trading volume. I assess whether there was significant trading activity and how it might impact the market throughout the day, updating my view based on the latest information.	Education, Technology, Innovation
33. When evaluating the market, I consider open interest, funding rates, and liquidation levels to gauge sentiment. For example, if open interest is high and funding is negative, it might indicate that the market is positioned bearishly, but this doesn't always mean the market will reverse immediately.	Technology
34. Liquidations are a key factor in market movements. When a large number of traders are liquidated, it can create significant price swings. Understanding where liquidations might occur helps in predicting where large moves might happen and allows me to position myself accordingly.	"Technology  
Innovation  
Society"
35. I find that funding rates can provide insight into whether the market is being led by spot or derivatives. For instance, if funding is negative but the market is rising, it might indicate that spot buying is driving the market, while shorts are being forced to cover.	Technology
36. Open interest also helps in understanding the potential for future volatility. High open interest, especially in leveraged products like Binance futures, can indicate that a large move is coming. I use this data to assess the risk of entering a position and the likelihood of a squeeze.	Recovery
37. The evolution of market structure has been significant since I started trading in 2018. Initially, BitMEX was the dominant platform, especially for perpetual swaps, while OKEx and Huobi were known for their quarterly futures. Monitoring the basis on these platforms was crucial for understanding market sentiment.	Technology, Innovation, Communication
38. Quarterly futures used to be a much bigger part of the market, with significant volumes traded on platforms like OKEx. These contracts would expire every three months, and their behavior often provided insight into the overall market sentiment, especially when compared to perpetual swaps.	Society, Change, Identity
39. The quarterly futures markets, particularly on OKEx, were often dominated by Asian traders, and their movements could drastically impact market prices. For example, if a large amount of volume traded above or below other exchanges, it was usually a sign of significant long or short positioning.	Technology, Innovation, Advancement
40. Today, quarterly futures are much smaller, but they were once a live indicator of market sentiment. The aggressive trading in these contracts often led to large swings, especially during periods of high volatility, and understanding their behavior was key to successful trading.	Energy
41. I analyze open interest not just in isolation but in the context of price action. For example, a rise in open interest during a market rally could indicate that traders are adding long positions, but it’s important to consider whether this is driven by spot buying or derivatives.	Technology, Innovation, Future
42. Liquidations are another critical piece of the puzzle. By understanding where large numbers of traders are likely to be liquidated, I can predict where significant price moves might occur. This helps in timing entries and exits in the market, especially during periods of high volatility.	Leadership. Innovation. Collaboration.
43. The collateralization of futures contracts has evolved, with a shift from crypto-margined to stablecoin-margined products. This shift has reduced the risk of liquidation during market downturns, as traders are less exposed to price declines in the underlying asset they are trading.	Innovation
44. Stablecoin-margined contracts have become more popular because they allow traders to avoid the double risk of both their position and collateral losing value. This has led to more stable markets, but it also means that shorts in these contracts are more likely to be squeezed.	Creativity, Innovation, Expression
45. The evolution of the market from BitMEX dominance to a broader range of platforms, including Binance and FTX, has changed the way I analyze data. Each platform has different characteristics, and it’s important to understand which products are driving the market at any given time.	"Innovation  
Technology  
Sustainability"
46. For example, Binance now dominates the market with its futures products, but it’s important to differentiate between the stablecoin-margined and coin-margined contracts. Each has different implications for market behavior, and understanding these nuances is key to successful trading.	Binance
47. When looking at derivatives data, I often see misunderstandings on social media. For example, people might assume that rising open interest automatically means new shorts or longs are being added, without considering the context of how price and open interest have moved together.	Technology, Innovation, Development
48. Order books and order flow are also important tools for gauging market sentiment. By monitoring how orders are being filled and where liquidity is concentrated, I can get a better sense of whether the market is likely to move up or down in the short term.	Innovation, Technology, Development
49. Price action is another critical component of my analysis. While I don’t rely heavily on traditional technical analysis, I do pay attention to key horizontal levels, as these often represent areas where traders have placed significant positions or where liquidations are likely.	Analysis
50. My approach to trading is holistic, incorporating derivatives data, price action, and order flow. By understanding how these elements interact, I can develop a clearer picture of market sentiment and position myself accordingly, always keeping an eye on where risk and opportunity lie.	Trading
1. Good, good, uh very happy to be here. Yeah, it's always been a, I mean there is like layers and layers of lore. Um, I think the earliest lore is like, like my mom went to, uh, I think what's the word, fortune teller, right? Yeah.	"Innovation

11. I kind of just like had no idea until like sometimes like the trade kind of played out and I'm like oh interesting. Um, yeah that's how I started and yeah and then I, I shared a lot lot of ideas on Twitter, um, and then I was very lucky to have like an actual fund pick me up for a few months.

17. Like which which one pumps harder like like we kind of have a sense of binance have way deeper liquidity or like we we we we also have shoved on okx quar fatures like these were the biggest products by that back then and then okx was like a great platform.	Climate
18. To, uh, shove price back then because, uh H used to also be big and these was and HBY okx and binance was like very well arbed against each each other, um, and then coinbase Kraken was way more segregated because I feel like there the people that are between Asia and China.

21. But I I did not, uh, long nor short I I was just flat, um, the the fund didn't do too well but it did okay in Bitcoin terms, uh, but eventually, uh, I left and yeah just did my own got it.	Technology
22. Yeah, to that point. Yeah, what led you to take that leap like what made you say, you know what like let me do my own thing like wasn't like did you think that the opportunity was worth it? Um, because you don't really have a trafi background right like you just join the markets price go up price go down try to figure it out.	Technology, Innovation, Future

24. I think I was just more a bit of luck and other people just being bad back then. Um, I don't think it took that much to figure like to figure like stuff out or even just to like beat the market right so and I I seem like half of the trading going on is like just super gambling.
