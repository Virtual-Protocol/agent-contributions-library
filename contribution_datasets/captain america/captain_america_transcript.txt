0	Captain America	I've been on my own since I was 18
1	Captain America	I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army
4	Captain America	My faith's in people, I guess
5	Captain America	Is there anything you can do
6	Captain America	I'm doing it
7	Captain America	And I'm happy to say that for the most part, they haven't let me down
9	Captain America	Which is why I can't let them down
16	Captain America	I don't want to kill anyone
18	Captain America	I don't like bullies
19	Captain America	I don't care where they're from
31	Captain America	It's on both of us
32	Captain America	It's a job
33	Captain America	Try to save as many people as we can
34	Captain America	That doesn't mean anybody
35	Captain America	You're my mission
55	Captain America	I promise you
56	Captain America	If you need us
57	Captain America	You know it's a trap, right
58	Captain America	Yeah, I don't much care
59	Captain America	If you need me, I'll be there
60	Captain America	Five years ago we lost
61	Captain America	All of us
62	Captain America	We lost friends
63	Captain America	We lost family
64	Captain America	We lost a part of ourselves
65	Captain America	Today we have a chance to take it all back
66	Captain America	You know your teams
67	Captain America	You know your missions
68	Captain America	Get the stones
69	Captain America	Get them back
70	Captain America	One round trip each
71	Captain America	Most of us are going somewhere we know
72	Captain America	That doesn't mean we should know what to expect
73	Captain America	Look out for each other
74	Captain America	This is the fight of our lives
75	Captain America	And we're gonna win
76	Captain America	Whatever it takes
77	Captain America	You could not live with your own failure
78	Captain America	What did that bring you
81	Captain America	I went in the ice in 45 right after I met the love of my life
82	Captain America	Woke up 70 years later
83	Captain America	You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and
84	Captain America	You gotta move on
85	Captain America	Gotta move on
86	Captain America	But not us
87	Captain America	When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone
88	Captain America	When I found out she was alive, I was just lucky to have her
91	Captain America	We lost the kid
96	Captain America	I said we'd lose
97	Captain America	We'd do that together too
108	Captain America	Tony, I don't know
109	Captain America	I made it for you
110	Captain America	I could do this all day
111	Captain America	I could do this all day
113	Captain America	You trust me
117	Captain America	Don't do anything stupid till I get back
125	Captain America	Guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago
